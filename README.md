This project was completed as part of the "Practical Python for News Investigations" course at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. The assignment involved using text analysis to extract text or tables from multiple PDFs or other documents in order to quantify occurrences, search for names (such as individuals or companies), or analyze entities.

For this assignment, I focused on new proposed NPL (National Priorities List) sites and newly designated NPL sites available on the EPA website. I downloaded all the PDFs from the site and converted them into a text file, where I used regex to extract information such as tribe names.

There were some challenges with the code because the PDFs did not follow a uniform structureâ€”sometimes storing the same data in three different formats.
