An original National Priorities List (NPL) was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). CERCLA requires that EPA update the list at least annually. \\nT\\nhis document provides responses to public comments received on the Upper Columbia River site, proposed on \\nMarch 7, 2024 (89 FR 16498). This site is being added to the NPL based on an evaluation under EPA’s Hazard Ranking System (HRS) in a final rule published in the Federal Register in December 2024. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n iv  Introduction \\nThis document explains the rationale for adding the Upper Columbia River site in Upper Columbia River, \\nWashington to the National Priorities List (NPL) of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites and provides responses to \\npublic comments received on this site li sting proposal. The EPA proposed this site to the NPL on March 7, 2024 \\n(89 FR 16498). This site is being added to the NPL based on an evaluation under the Hazard Ranking System \\n(HRS) in a final rule published in the Federal Register in December 2024. \\n \\nBackground of the NPL \\nIn 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \\n(CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. Sections 9601 et seq . in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. \\nCERCLA was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), \\nPublic Law No. 99-499, stat., 1613 et seq. To implement CERCLA, EPA promulgated the revised National Oil \\nand Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA Section 105 and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP, further \\nrevised by EPA on September 16, 1985 (50 FR 37624) and November 20, 1985 (50 FR 47912), sets forth \\nguidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. On March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666), EPA further revised the NCP in \\nresponse to SARA.  \\n Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the NCP include:  \\n \\ncriteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United \\nStates for the purpose of taking remedial action and, to the extent practicable, taking into account \\nthe potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action. \\n Removal action involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response to emergency conditions or on a \\nshort-term or temporary basis (CERCLA Section 101). Remedial action is generally long- term in nature and \\ninvolves response actions that are consiste nt with a permanent remedy for a release (CERCLA Section 101). \\nCriteria for placing sites on the NPL, which makes them eligible for remedial actions financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA, were included in the HRS. EPA promulgated the HRS as Appendix A of the NCP \\n(47 FR 31219, July 16, 1982). On December 14, 1990 (56 FR 51532), EPA promulgated revisions to the HRS in \\nresponse to SARA, and established the effective date for the HRS revisions as March 15, 1991. On January 9, \\n2017, EPA promulgated a further revision to the HRS that added a component for evaluating the threats posed by the intrusion of subsurface contamination into regularly occupied structures. These changes are consistent with, \\nand comply with, the statutory requirements of SARA.  \\n \\nSection 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended, requires that the statutory criteria provided by the HRS be used to \\nprepare a list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throu ghout the United States. The list, which is Appendix B of the NCP, is the NPL. \\n An original NPL of 406 sites was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). At that time, an HRS score \\nof 28.5 was established as the cutoff for listing because it yielded an initial NPL of at least 400 sites, as suggested \\nby CERCLA. The NPL has been expanded several times since then, most recently on September 5, 2024 (89 FR 72331). The Agency also has published a number of proposed rulemakings to add sites to the NPL. The most \\nrecent proposal was on September 5, 2024 (89 FR 72356). \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n v  Development of the NPL \\nThe primary purpose of the NPL is stated in the legislative history of CERCLA (Report of the Committee on \\nEnvironment and Public Works, Senate Report No. 96-848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 [1980]).  \\nThe priority list serves primarily informational purposes, identifying for the States and the public those facilities and sites or other releases which appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a \\nfacility or site on the list does not in itself refle ct a judgment of the activities of its owner or \\noperator, it does not require those persons to undertake any action, nor does it assign liability to \\nany person. Subsequent government actions will be necessary in order to do so, and these actions \\nwill be attended by all appropriate procedural safeguards. \\n The NPL, therefore, is primarily an informational and management tool. The identification of a site for the NPL is \\nintended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of the human health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA -\\nfinanced remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of sites EPA believes warrant further investigation. Finally, listing a site may , to the extent potentially responsible parties are \\nidentifiable at the time of listing, serve as notice to such parties that the Agency may initiate CERCLA -financed \\nremedial action.  \\n CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites among the known releases or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, and Section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certain \\nenumerated and other appropriate factors in doing so. Thus, as a matter of policy, EPA has the discretion not to \\nuse CERCLA to respond to certain types of releases. Where other authorities exist, placing sites on the NPL for \\npossible remedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Ther efore, EPA has chosen not to place certain \\ntypes of sites on the NPL even though CERCLA does not exclude such action. If, however, the Agency later \\ndetermines that sites not listed as a matter of policy are not being properly responded to, the Agency may consider \\nplacing them on the NPL. \\n \\nHazard Ranking System \\nThe HRS is the principal mechanism EPA uses to place uncontrolled waste sites on the NPL. It is a numerically \\nbased screening system that uses information from initial, limited investigations -- the preliminary assessment and \\nsite inspection -- to assess t he relative potential of sites to pose a threat to human health or the environment. HRS \\nscores, however, do not determine the sequence in which EPA funds remedial response actions, because the information collected to develop HRS scores is not sufficient i n itself to determine either the extent of \\ncontamination or the appropriate response for a particular site. Moreover, the sites with the highest scores do not necessarily come to the Agency\\'s attention first, so that addressing sites strictly on the basis of ranking would in \\nsome cases require stopping work at sites where it was already underway. Thus, EPA relies on further, more detailed studies in the remedial investigation/feasibility study that typically follows listing.  \\n The HRS uses a structured value analysis approach to scoring sites. This approach assigns numerical values to \\nfactors that relate to or indicate risk, based on conditions at the site. The factors are grouped into three categories. \\nEach category has a maxim um value. The categories are:  \\n \\n• likelihood that a site has released or has the potential to release hazardous substances into the \\nenvironment; Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\nvi •characteristics of the waste (e.g., toxicity and waste quantity); and\\n•targets (e.g., people or sensitive environments) affected by the release.\\nUnde\\nr the HRS, four pathways can be scored for one or more components and threats as identified below: \\n•Gr\\nound Water Migration (S gw)\\n— population\\n•Su\\nrface Water Migration (S sw)\\nThe following threats are evaluated for two separate migration components, overland/flood migration and\\nground water to surface water.\\n— drinking water\\n— human food chain\\n— sensitive environments\\n•Soi\\nl Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion (S sessi)\\n— Soil Exposure Component:\\no resident population\\no nearby population\\n— Subsurface Intrusion Component\\nopopulation\\n•Ai\\nr Migration (S a)\\n— population\\nAf\\nter scores are calculated for one or more pathways according to prescribed guidelines, they are combined using \\nthe following root -mean -square equation to determine the overall site score (S), which ranges from 0 to 100 : \\nIf all pathway scores are low, the HRS score is low. However, the HRS score can be relatively high even if only \\none pathway score is high. This is an important requirement for HRS scoring because some extremely \\ndangerous sites pose threats through only one pathway. For example, buried leaking drums of hazardous \\nsubstances can c ontaminate drinking water wells, but - - if the drums are buried deep enough and the substances \\nnot very volatile -- not surface water or air. \\nOther Mechanisms for Listing \\nThere are two mechanisms other than the HRS by which sites can be p laced  on the NPL. The first of these \\nmechanisms, authorized by the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), allows each State and Territory to designate one \\nsite as its high est priority regardless of score. The last mechanism,  authorized by the NCP at 40  CFR \\n300.425(c)(3), allows listing a site if it meets the following three requirements: \\n•Ag\\nency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued\\na health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release;\\n•EPA determines the site poses a significant threat to public health; andUpper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n vii  • EPA anticipates it will be more cost- effective to use its remedial authority than to use its emergency removal \\nauthority to respond to the site.  \\n \\nOrganization of this Document \\nThe following section contains EPA responses to site- specific public comments received on the proposal of the \\nUpper Columbia River site on March 7, 2024 (89 FR 16498). The site discussion begins with a list of \\ncommenters, followed by a site description, a summary of comments, and Agency responses to each comment.

Site Description \\nThe Upper Columbia River site (the Site) includes the release of metals from two smelters (Cominco1 and Le Roi \\nsmelters) to the Upper Columbia River and to soil . Associated contamination in the area is the combined result of \\nhistorical discharges of wastes and emissions from the two smelter operations, some of which has comingled in \\nsoils and surface water sediments. Upland soils in the area are contaminated with  metals, including arsenic and \\nlead. Sediments in the Upper Columbia River contain slag, a by- product of smelting, and are contaminated with \\n \\n1 The Cominco smelter is also known as the Trail Smelter and the Teck Cominco Smelter.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 5  metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc. There is a significant \\nquantity of slag present in the river system. The Site is being placed on the NPL based on an HRS evaluation of \\nthe Site documenting that contamination in sediments and soil achieve an NPL-eligible HRS site score. Although \\nthe contamination has comingled, the HRS documentation record at proposal also showed that releases associated with the Cominco smelter (approximately 10 miles upstream of the i nternational border) and releases associated \\nwith the Le Roi smelter (approximately 10 river miles downstream of the international border) each would independently achieve an NPL qualifying HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately. \\n \\nThe HRS evaluation of the Site scored the surface water migration pathway based on concentrations of hazardous substances in sediment s from the Upper Columbia River and the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway \\nbased on the concentrations of hazardous substances in soil . As presented in the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal, the Site, for HRS scoring purposes, includes contaminated sediments in the Upper Columbia River \\nbetween and downstream of the three scored HRS sources spanning approximately 35 river miles of the Columbia \\nRiver  from the U.S.-Canada border south and west to Marcus, Washington (see Figure 1 of this support document \\nbelow). The Site includes three scored sources: slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter, \\nwhich is currently owned by Teck Metals Ltd.  and located upstream of the international border in Canada (Source \\n1); contaminated soil on the  former Le Roi smelter facility in Northport, Washington (Source 2); and sluice box \\ndischarge associated with the former Le Roi smelter (Source 3). These sources have been documented to contain metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver, zinc, and mercury. The \\nreleases from the smelters have become comingled in the Upper Columbia River (at and downstream of the Le \\nRoi smelter) . In addition, an area of observed contamination (AOC) in soil in Northport, Washington was \\ndocumented in the HRS documentation record at proposal. R eleases from both facilities have also  become \\ncomingled in the AOC soil contamination.  \\nIn the evaluation of the surface water migration pathway, contamination and targets were scored in the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal for the U.S. portion of the zone of contamination, which encompasses a length of approximately 35 river miles. Both an observed release by direct observation and an observed release by \\nchemical analysis were documented. Observed releases by direct observation were scored based on Cominco smelter discharge of hazardous substance-bearing slag/effluent to the river and Le Roi smelter discharge of \\nhazardous substance -bearing slag to the river. An observed release by chemical analysis based on the \\nconcentrations of metals (i.e., antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc) in sediment s was established in the HRS documentation record at proposal. Targets in the surface water migration \\npathway (i.e., fishery, wetlands, and a federal- designated threatened species habitat) were evaluated as subject to \\nLevel II concentrations. \\n \\nIn the evaluation of the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, t he AOC \\nis located in a residential area to the southwest of the former Le Roi smelter and is defined by a polygon bounded \\nby soil contamination meeting HRS observed contamination criteria (i.e., locations showing lead and arsenic at \\nconcentrations significantly above published background levels and collected from the top 2 feet of soil). This \\nAOC is attributable to historical aerial deposition from both smelters. Historical smelter smokestack emissions \\nfrom both smelters have resulted in upland residential soil contamination; residential populations subject to Level \\nI and Level II contamination for HRS scoring purposes  associated with the AOC were documented in the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal for the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion \\npathway.  \\n \\nSince 2003, numerous EPA removal activities have occurred in and around the Northport, Washington area, inc\\nluding several removal site evaluations (RSEs). In 2003 and 2004, Northport residential and commercial \\nproperties with lead concentrations in soil greater than the removal action level  of 1,000 milligrams per kilogram \\n(mg/kg ) were identified for a time-critical removal action (TCRA). In 2004, a removal action was conducted at \\nthe former Le Roi smelter and residential areas with the excavated contaminat ed soils being consolidated at an 11-\\nacre area of the Le Roi smelter site. In 2014 and 2016, residential properties and tribal allotments were sampled. \\nFor these sampling events, a removal action level of 700 mg/kg for lead in soil was evaluated.  In an EPA dispute Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 6  decision issued in 2015, EPA stated an intent to select a lower removal action level for lead in soil, lowering the \\naction level from 1,000 mg/kg to 700 mg/kg. Based on analytical results from residential soil sampling, TCRAs \\nwere conducted in 2015, 2017, and 2018 using a removal action level of 700 mg/kg. The EPA conducted \\nadditional RSE s at properties within the town of Northport that were sampled in 2003 and 2004 as described \\nabove and found to have lead in soil at concentrations near or above 700 mg/kg. In 2020, soil cleanup activities \\nwere conducted  using a removal action level of 700 mg/kg. The EPA conducted a subsequent RSE in the \\nresidential area of Northport in 2021. TCRAs were conducted at additional properties in 2022 using a removal action level for lead in soil of 700 mg/kg. In 2024, additional TCRAs were conducted using a removal action level \\nof 200 mg/kg.  \\n \\nAddi\\ntional investigations have been ongoing at the Site, including a remedial investigation and feasibility study \\n(RI/FS). The RI/FS is underway as part of the 2006 Settlement Agreement between Teck Cominco Metals Ltd., Teck Cominco American Incorporated (TAI), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and the EPA; there is no\\n \\nsettlement agreement for funding or performance of a potential remedial action . In February 2021, the EPA \\nreleased a Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) for the Upper Columbia River site, which was conducted as \\npart of the ongoing RI/FS. An Upland Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment and an Aquatic Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment are also underway. The ongoing RI/FS will guide subsequent stages of the CERCLA process, \\nand information from completed, ongoing, and subsequent investigations will inform the ultimate extent of s ite-\\nrelated contamination. Completed site investigations and remedial work, as well as time critical removal actions,  \\nwere considered  in the HRS evaluation of the Site, and the current conditions in sediments and soil at the Site \\nachieve an HRS site score, describ ed above, that is eligible for placement on the NPL as presented in the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal.   \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 7   \\nFi\\ngure 1.

Summary of Comments  \\nThe state of Washington, the Spokane Tribe of Indians , the Confederated Tribes of the Co lville Reservation2 the \\nLands Council, the Upper Columbia United Tribes , the Spokane Mountaineers, and 20 citizens supported or did \\nnot oppose placing the Site on the NPL.  \\n \\nTeck American Incorporated3 (TAI) , the Stevens County Board of County Commissioners4 (hereinafter referred \\nto as Stevens County), the Eastern Washington Council of Governments (EWCOG), the Lincoln County \\nCommissioners (Lincoln County), South Columbia Basin Irrigation District (SCBID), East Columbia Basin Irrigation District (ECBID) , Quincy- Columbia Basin Irrigation District (QCBID) , Board of Commissioners, \\nCounty of Benton ( Benton County ), the Rimrock Cabin Owners Association, and 47 citizens opposed placing the \\nSite on the NPL. TAI also requested that the EPA consider its comments prior to adding the Site on the NPL.  \\n TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens provided comments on the supporting data and documentation. TAI \\nand Stevens County questioned the data included in the HRS documentation record at proposal, asserting that \\nadditional data and information were available as a part of the ongoing RI/FS. TAI stated that “arbitrarily limited \\ndata and completed studies” were used. TAI commented that evaluating the Site with the HRS is inappropriate \\ngiven the level of investigation into the Site already completed.  \\n \\nIn discussing the Site as presented at proposal, TAI and Stevens County commented  on perceived difference s \\nbetween the site as described in previous EPA communication and the Site as scored. TAI and Stevens County asserted that past descriptions of the Site pointed to uplands residential soil contamination , while the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal primarily focuses on the sediment contamination in the Upper Columbia River.   \\nTAI questioned the inclusion of the Northport area as part of the Site asserting  that the Northport area has \\nhistorically been treated as a separate site from the Upper Columbia River. TAI disagreed with comingling of the \\nsmelters’ contamination in soil as the basis for inclusion of the Northport area as part of the site, asserting that \\nCominco smelter aerial emissions are limited to the smelter in British Columbia and a few miles into Washington .  \\n Several commenters submitted comments discussing possible effects of the NPL designation. TAI, Stevens County, and multiple citizens expressed concern for how liability will be assigned for the contamination and/or \\nwhat the sources of funding for remediati on of the contamination will be. Stevens County, Lincoln County, \\nSCBID, QCBID , ECBID  and 20 citizens provided comments discussing the possible impacts to the region, \\nincluding negative economic impacts, as a result of a NPL designation.  \\n Several commenters opposed to listing provided comments discussing issues related to the listing process. \\nComments related to the listing process include:  \\n \\n• Comments questioning the rationale for listing given that the Site is undergoing an RI/FS.  \\n• Comments asserting that the HRS is intended for a limited evaluation of a Site in the preliminary stages of the evaluation process.  \\n• Assertions that there is no need for listing based on the conditions at the Site.  \\n \\n2 See the December 6, 2023 , letter from the Confederated Tribes of the Col ville Reservation  to EPA, included as Attachment \\nA of this support document . \\n3 Teck American Incorporated  submitted comments on the proposed listing and is an affiliate of Teck Metals Ltd. , the owner \\nand operator of the Trail smelter  (also referred to as the Cominco Smelter and the Teck Cominco Smelter)  in Canada .  \\n4 The Stevens County Board of County Commissioners submitted comments on its behalf along with comments on behalf of \\nthe Eastern Washington Council of Governments. (See Docket ID EPA -HQ-OLEM -2024- 0068 -0080 on regulations.gov  fo r \\nthe combined comment submission by Stevens County and the Eastern Washington Council of Governments.) Comments \\nspecifically authored by the Eastern Washington Council of Governments were included as Attachment E of the combined comment submission.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 9  • Assertions that information about the Site has been delayed or withheld.  \\n• Requests that listing not occur until after the completion of the RI/FS for the Site.  \\n• Comments that ecological benefits are overdue and ineffective.  \\n \\nAdditionally, in Attachments A5 and D6 to its comment submission, in opposition of NPL listing and \\ndisagreement with the state concurrence with listing,  Stevens County stated that they “do not relinquish” their \\n“authority as elected officials over to the governor.”  \\n \\nMultiple commenters discussed whether the risk posed by the Site is sufficient for NPL placement, commenting  \\nthat: \\n \\n• The Site does not pose a risk to human health.  \\n• Fish from the Upper Columbia River are generally not impacted .  \\n• Soil contamination at residential properties is being or has been addressed via removal actions or remedial \\nactivities .  \\n• The quality of water in the Columbia River is clean and/or meets water quality standards.  \\n• The area is clean except for rubbish.  \\n In questioning technical aspects of the HRS scoring of the Site, TAI commented that slag is not a hazardous \\nsubstance under CERCLA , and that the solid waste definition in 40 CFR 261.4 excludes slag. TAI asserted that \\nsince slag is not a hazardous substance under CER CLA, using slag to determine the hazardous waste quantity for \\nSource 1 is incorrect and misleading.  \\n In challenging the evaluation of the surface water migration pathway, commenters asserted that : \\n \\n• The slag in the river is unlikely to release metals.   \\n• Contamination is buried in sediment at deeper depths , and it would be safer to leave it as-is than risking \\nrereleasing the associated metals by stirring sediments during removal processes .  \\n• The other possible sources not scored section of the HRS documentation record at proposal is incomplete  \\nbecause it does not discuss other possible origins of contamination .  \\n• The waste characteristics factor category value was inappropriately calculated and overestimated . \\n• Fish from the Columbia River are generally safe for consumption.  \\n• The Site may not be the driver of fish advisories in place for sensitive groups .  \\n In commenting on the evaluation of the soil exposure component, commenters asserted  that: \\n \\n• The soil exposure component would no t achieve an NPL -eligible score by itself .  \\n• The extent of residential contamination described in general EPA communications is an overstatement of \\nthe residential land use area.  \\n• Areas identified as residential for scoring purposes or future cleanup purposes inappropriately included \\nforest, industrial, and commercial areas.  \\n• Only limited soil contamination remains because properties above the action level have been remediated.  \\n \\nIn this support document, the EPA responds to comments submitted on the March 2024 proposed listing of the \\nUpper Columbia River  site. After consideration of these items, the HRS site score remains unchanged , and the \\nEPA is appropriately placing the site on the NPL.  \\n \\n \\n5 Attachment A of Stevens County’s comment submission is a January 16, 2024 , letter to Calvin Terada, EPA.  \\n6 Attachment D of Stevens County’s comment submission is a January 16, 2024 , letter to Jay Inslee, Governor, s tate of \\nWashington.

T hey commented  \\nthat NPL listing will bring access to resources needed for cleanup of the Site.  \\nThe Spokane Tribe of Indians expresse d support for NPL lis ting, referring  to the negative impacts associated w ith \\nSite-related c ontamination , such as health and  welfare impacts, economi c security,  and political integrity of the \\nSpokane Tribe of Indians. The Spokane Tribe of Indians asserted that delays have occurred as a resu lt of the Site \\nnot being placed on the NPL and the RI/FS process is still ongoing. O ther reason s for support cited by the \\nSpokane Tribe of Indians include the ability of the EPA to use federal funding, control of cleanup , cost recovery, \\nthe ability o f the EPA to  better c haracterize the  contamination.   \\nThe Spokane Tribe of Indians concurred wit h the propose d listing of the Site on the NPL assumi ng that the Site is \\n“meant to encompass the Upper Columbia River from the U.S. Canadia n border and downstream , including Lake \\nRoosevelt, to the Grand Coulee Dam.” The Spokane Tribe of Indians commente d that the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal provided an incomplete characterizati on of the contamination i n that it focuse d on the area \\nfrom the border to Marcus , Washington, and requeste d that future remedial inve stigations and  response activities \\ncharacteri ze the  lower r iver.  \\nThe Upper Columbia United Tribes supported the proposal to add the Site to the NPL, stating that NPL placement \\nwould allow for fundi ng, legal status , and resources t o address contamination affecting the land, water, and \\nwildlife. T he U pper C olumbia U nited Tribes asserted t hat site-related co ntaminants, suc h as metals, may be \\nposing a risk to human health a nd the environment. T hey stated that the “ federal government should dedicate \\nmore resources to address t he legacy of  heavy  metal p ollution  in the waters and lands of the uppe r Columbia \\nRegion.” They als o stated that the government should procee d “in recovering clea n and s afe environments in \\nsupport of these recovery efforts and the communities who stand to benefit from them.” \\nMultiple citizens and the Spokane Mountaineers support ed listing. O ne citizen provided support for listing i f \\naccess to the Upper Columbia River or Lake Roosevelt is not restricted. A citizen commented that CERCLA \\nactivities have fallen short in addressing sites in the past. One citizen also asserted that negative economic impacts \\n7 See the December 6, 2023 , letter from the Confederated Tribes of the Col ville Reservation  to EPA, included as Attachment \\nA of this support document . Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 11  may not necessarily occur and property values may not necessarily decrease. Additional reasons for support \\nprovided by commenters include: \\n \\n• Cleanup of s ite-related contamination  \\n• Protection of human health, wildlife, and/or the environment  \\n• Possible negotiations and funding for cleanup  \\n• Positive impacts to the economy as a result of remediation of contamination  \\n• The possible removal of buried waste at the former Le Roi smelter property.  \\n \\nThe Lands Council and a citizen expressed a request for cooperation with tribes in addressing the Site.  \\n \\nResponse : The EPA has added the Upper Columbia River site to the NPL. Listing makes a site eligible for \\nremedial action funding under CERCLA, and the EPA will examine the site to determine what response, if any, is \\nappropriate. Actual funding may not necessarily be undertaken in the precise order of HRS scores, however, and upon more detailed investigation may not be necessary at all in some cases. The EPA will determine the need for \\nusing Superfund monies for remedial activities on a site-by- site basis, considering the NPL ranking, State \\npriorities, further site investigation, other response alternatives, and other factors as appropriate.  \\n \\nRegarding the Site definition and extent of S ite, please see sections 3.4, Site Description and Definition , and 3.5, \\nExtent of Site, of this support document.  \\n  Regarding a commenter’s concern about access to the Upper Columbia River, the EPA acknowledges the \\ncommenter ’s concern and notes that access to the river is not determined by the listing decision.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.2 Community Involvement \\nComment : TAI , Stevens County, and six citizens submitted comments about EPA communications to the public, \\nthe level of community involvement, and the EPA’s coordination with local government.  \\n \\nTAI stated that the EPA made incorrect statements in public communications about benefits the EPA may gain \\nthrough NPL designation. TAI asserted that the EPA’s news release about the proposed listing of the Upper \\nColumbia River site on the NPL “incorrectly suggests that a site listing automatically ensures EPA can access \\nSuperfund dollars: ‘Listing the site on the NPL allows EPA to access Superfund dollars for cleanup activities \\nwhich can also help ensure a more timely cleanup.’”8 TAI commented NPL listing makes sites eligible for federal \\nfunding, and it  does not guarantee that funding. TAI also pointed to a local newspaper article in which an EPA \\nspokesman stated that NPL listing gives the EPA “access to  legal tools that could compel action if needed.”9 \\nHowever, TAI argued that NPL listing “does not, in itself, reflect the responsible parties or the bases of their \\nliability, require those entities to take any action, determine whether remediation is possible or even necessary or \\nthe extent of any potential remediation, or assign liability to any person or entity.” TAI also argued that NPL \\nlisting does not give the EPA additional enforcement authority.  \\n \\nStevens County and multiple citizens discussed the level of community involvement and coordination with local \\ngovernment. Stevens County commented that while the EPA has indicated that it would like to work with the \\ncommunity and local officials to ensure contaminated areas that have been identified are within acceptable levels, \\n \\n8 TAI cited a March 5, 2024 EPA news release available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -\\ncolumbia -river -wa-superfund- list. TAI quoted the statement, “L isting the site on the NPL allows EPA to access Superfund \\ndollars for cleanup activities which can also help ensure a more timely cleanup. ” \\n9 TAI cited a March 5, 2024 article in The Spokesman -Review available at \\nhttps://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/mar/05/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -to-superf/ .  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 12  it has been not included in the process. Five  citizens commented that local officials’ input has been ignored, and \\nthree of these citizens argued that local officials would be communicating there is a problem if concerning levels \\nof contamination were present in the Upper Columbia River area. Five ci tizens also stated that the urgency to list \\nthe Site on the NPL is politically motivated.  \\n \\nStevens County stated that “ local elected officials do not concur with EPA that NPL listing is needed or warranted \\nat this time .” Stevens County asserted that it is “willing to help” and “EPA regional staff should be focused on \\nworking with the local governments.” Stevens County commented that it is willing to cooperate to find solutions \\nfor health, safety, and ecological concerns. Two citizens commented that government officials opposed the designation, and one of these citizens suggested that local officials should be consulted about the issue.  \\n \\nStevens County asserted that EPA provided insufficient information and communication. It commented that:  \\n \\n• The EPA has delayed and withheld information .  \\n• A local group received a draft document— the draft Upland Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment \\n(BERA) —from the EPA for comment while the local government was not given the same opportunity.  \\n• The messaging provided by the EPA suggested soil contamination is the issue at the Site although the \\nscoring of the Site relied on other data.  \\n• Data used in the listing, including compounds and metals other than lead, were not provided to the local government.  \\n• The EPA has not been transparent in the process, and misleading information about the process has been provided.  \\n• The EPA provided different information in public meetings than in the proposal to add the Site to the NPL.  \\n• The Governor provided a concurrence letter to the EPA without obtaining input from the local government.  \\n• Local public health offices were not consulted.  \\n One citizen requested that, before allowing federal government and EPA involvement, local residents should be \\nallowed to participate and given a controlling vote. Two  citizen s asserted that local individuals would be more \\nfamiliar with the area. A citizen also commented that the local community should be given opportunities for input and discussion along with local voting options for agreed-upon cleanup.  \\n \\nResponse : The EPA communicated with  the public frequently during the site assessment and RI/FS stage s and has \\nmade multiple efforts to involve the community and other interested parties throughout the RI/FS  and site \\nassessment stages. The EPA will continue community engagement efforts for the Site throughout the CERCLA \\nprocess.   \\n Regarding the procedures used to list the Site on the NPL, the EPA complied with all relevant administrative \\nrequirements. The HRS evaluation of the Site is consistent with the HRS regulation and the Administrative \\nProcedure Act (APA). The HRS documentation record at proposal and this support document clearly document \\nthat the EPA has complied with the HRS regulation; this support document addresses all comments on the \\nproposed listing of this Site, including those comments that challenge compliance with the HRS, and shows that \\nHRS requirements have been met in every aspect of the evaluation of this Site.  \\n \\nAs part of the standard community involvement process, the Superfund program offers numerous opportunities \\nfor public participation at NPL sites. The EPA Regional Office develop s a Community Involvement Plan (CIP) \\nbefore  remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS)  field work begins . The CIP is the “work plan” for Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 13  community relations activities that the EPA will conduct during the entire cleanup process. In developing a CIP, \\nRegional staff interview s State and local officials and interested citizens to learn about citizen concerns, site \\nconditions, and local history. This information is used to formulate a schedule of activities designed to keep citizens apprised and to keep the EPA aware of community concerns. Typical community relations activities \\ninclude: \\n \\n• Public meetings where  the EPA presents a summary of technical information regarding the site and \\ncitizens can ask questions or comment  \\n• Small, informal public sessions where  EPA representatives are available to citizens \\n• Development and distribution of fact sheets to keep citizens up to date on site activities \\n \\nFor each site , an “information repository” is established, usually in a librar y or town hall  and/or on an EPA Web \\nsite, containing reports, studies, fact sheets, and other documents containing information about the site. The  EPA \\nRegional Office continually updates the repository and must ensure that the facility housing the repository has copying capabilities. For the Upper Columbia River site, t he EPA Regional Office developed a CIP for the Site in \\n2004 before the start of the RI/FS, and information repositories have been established in libraries in the local communities . \\n \\nIn addition to meeting federal requirements, the  EPA ensure s that community involvement is a continuing activity \\ndesigned to meet the specific needs of the community. Anyone wanting information should contact the Community Involvement Coordinator in the appropriate EPA Regional Office.  \\n To provide information about the ongoing progress at the Upper Columbia River site , because a remedial \\ninvestigation/feasibility study is ongoing, the EPA maintains an Upper Columbia River Study Area webpage \\n(https://www.epa.gov/columbiariver/upper- columbia -river -study- area). This webpage provides the community \\nand other interested parties information regarding the Site status, publicly available documents, including fact sheets, and other relevant site- specific information. The EPA hosted numerous outreach events in the community \\nregarding the Site . These outreach activities have included public meetings and briefings with members of \\nCongress and local officials. Table 1 below presents a selected list of outreach events the EPA conducted prior to proposal. \\n \\nT\\nable 1: Recent Upper Columbia River Outreach Events  \\n \\nDatea  EPA Outreach Event  \\nOctober 15, 2019  Northport public meeting on HHRA  \\nOctober 16, 2019  Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation public meeting on HHRA  \\nNovember 20, 2019  HHRA update presentation at the Lake Roosevelt Forum conference  \\nJune 10, 2020  HHRA overview public webinar  \\nJuly 15, 2020  HHRA overview public webinar ( repeat ed presentation)  \\nJune 28, 2023  Brief ed congressional representatives  on Site update and NPL proposal   \\nJune 28, 2023  Conversation with Teck  on NPL proposal  \\nJuly 24, 2023  Brief ed Northeast  Tri-County Health Dept . and W ashington  Dept. of Health  \\non NPL proposal  \\nJuly 17, 2023  Brief ed Stevens County Commissioners on NPL proposal  \\nJuly 24, 2023  Brief ed Ferry County Commissioners on NPL proposal  \\nAugust 7, 2023  Brief ed Lincoln County Commissioners  on NPL proposal  \\nAugust 9, 2023  Brief ed Northport Town Council  and Mayor Karene Balcom  on NPL proposal  \\nSeptember  19, 2023  Brief ed Grant County Commissioners on NPL proposal  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 14  Datea  EPA Outreach Event  \\nSeptember  29, 2023  Eastern W ashington  Council of Governments meeting  \\nNovember  27, 2023  Citizens for a Clean Columbia informal meeting with members and potential \\nguests to brief on Site update and NPL proposal (with Q&A)  \\nNovember  28, 2023  Brief ed U.S. Senators Murray and Cantwell ’s staff \\nNovember  28, 2023  Site update with Southern, Eastern, and Quincy Irrigation Districts  \\nJanuary 18, 2024  Brief ed Representative  McMorris Rodgers ’ staff \\nJuly 17, 2024  EPA and Citizens for Clean Columbia co-hosted a community meeting at \\nNorthport High School  \\na – The EPA notes that this table reflects recent outreach events. Additional outreach activities have been conducted by EPA  \\nRegion 10 dating back to 200 0 regarding the Upper Columbia River site.  \\n \\nAdditionally, as part of the EPA’s Technical Assistance Services for Communities  program , the EPA awarded \\nCitizens for a Clean Columbia a technical assistance contract to fund participation and a review of the RI/FS \\nprocess. The EPA provides further information regarding community technical assistance on its Upper Columbia \\nRiver Study A rea webpage.  \\n \\nRegarding coordination with the public and other interested parties or stakeholders, t he CERCLA process \\nencourages public participation , including potentially responsible parties. The public can comment during the \\ncomment period (typically 60 days) after a site is proposed for listing on the NPL and during the time the EPA is \\nevaluating and selecting a remedy. The EPA may also hold a publ ic hearing during the latter decision -making \\nperiod. If private parties conduct remedial actions under a consent decree between the EPA and the parties, the decree is also subject to public comment. The EPA believes that the above process offers the public sufficient opportunity to present facts and opinions germane to its decision-making.   \\n Regarding comments addressing the tools that become accessible to the EPA as a result of  listing a site, the EPA \\nstatements referred to by TAI and communicated to the public regarding funding and legal tools are correct. In \\npublic communications the EPA stated that NPL listing allow s the EPA “to access Superfund dollars for cleanup \\nactivities .” This statement did not assert that such funding is automatic at listing  or that remedial action is \\nautomatic. Listing a site on the NPL also gives the EPA “access to legal tools that could compel action if needed.” This statement by the EPA about access to legal tools does not imply that the NPL listing itself assigns liability or \\nrequires specific remedial actions.  With NPL listing, EPA may use federal funds to advance CERCLA response \\nactions when negotiations with a potentially responsible party or parties (PRPs) are not successful or become protracted, or if a PRP is not in compliance with an enforcement order or settlement agreement . The EPA would \\nthen seek to recover its costs from the PRP (s). This approach incentivizes PRPs to negotiate or to comple te work  \\nbecau se the cost for a private party to conduct work is generally less expensive than costs incurred by the EPA . \\nBoth the EPA statement on potential funding from an NPL listing and enforcement tools that may be available \\nfrom listing are consistent with the explanation of the limited significance of the NPL outlined in the Federal \\nRegister  notice proposing this Site to the NPL (89 FR 16498). \\n Regarding the information and data used to support the proposed addition of the Site to the NPL, please see \\nsection 3.3, Adequacy of Documentation, of this support document for a detailed discussion.  \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  \\n \\n3.3 Adequacy of Documentation  \\nComment: TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens asserted that insufficient data or documentation were \\navailable to support placing the Site on the NPL.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 15  TAI and Stevens County commented that the Site has been extensively studied as part of the RI/FS and these data \\nwere not included in the HRS scoring of the Site. TAI commented that the HRS is not appropriate for the Site \\nbecause of the extensive investigation already completed for the Site. Stevens County stated that the HRS scoring \\nis incomplete. TAI stated that the HRS scoring “did not incorporate the bulk of the RI/FS data” and used “arbitrarily limited data and completed studies” despite the availabilit y of additional technical information that is \\nsometimes more current and comprehensive. Stevens County also commented that prior data are available from the RI/FS process on the Upper Columbia River. TAI asserted that the most recent data from the RI/FS sh ould be \\nused to reflect the current risk posed by the Site.   In discussing the data used, Stevens County stated that the HRS scoring used “other unscientific data to list the \\narea on the NPL.” Stevens County commented that HRS scoring should be completed based on the known risk \\nassociated with the Site as opposed to “guesses.” Stevens County commented that data for compounds and metals \\nother than lead used in the documentation to support the proposed listing were not provided to it.  \\n \\nStevens County and 10 citizens made additional assertions regarding the adequacy of the supporting \\ndocumentation. Stevens County asserted that it is unclear why the Site achieved an NPL eligible HRS site score given that no human health risk is associated with the Site and no c onclusive data on sediment contamination \\nfrom the Upper Columbia River are present. Four  citizens commented that the proposed designation lacks \\nscientific evidence to support the decision. Four  citizens commented that placing the Site on the NPL prior to the \\ncompletion of the RI/FS suggests that the decision is being made without important data. Three citizens commented that there is a lack of scientific data to support the NPL designation or scope of the Site because the RI/FS process  is still underway. Two citizens expressed opposition to the proposed NPL designation until \\nongoing studies have been completed and verified. As part of the assertion that available data were incomplete, three citizens stated that there are no blood test r esults for children living in the impacted area that would support \\nlisting the Site on the NPL.   Regarding availability of documentation and data, one citizen commented that the five documents for review did \\nnot include data tables or a map. This citizen also asserted that the fact sheet appears to indicate that remediation \\noccurred at the areas with higher contamination and no associated data were provided.  \\n \\nResponse : \\n The data relied upon in the HRS documentation record at proposal are of sufficient quantity and type \\nfor the purposes of scoring the Site and Site placement on the NPL. Relevant data for the NPL listing were \\nincluded in the HRS documentation record referen ces at proposal and are available to the public via the Site \\ndocket10. Documents referenced in the HRS documentation record at proposal were available to the public upon \\nrequest via the Region 10 S ite docket at the time of proposal  as described in the Federal Register notice proposing \\nthe Site to the NPL . The docket for the Site at the time of proposal was also sufficient for the public to review the \\nHRS evaluation of the Site. As shown in other sections of this support document, the scoring of the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway were \\nsupported in the HRS documentation record at proposal and achieved an HRS site score a bove the NPL listing \\nthreshold of 28.50.  \\nThe EPA used appropriate levels of data and investigation in determining the HRS score for the Site consistent \\nwith HRS regulation. As explained in the preamble in the Federal Register notice promulgating the 1990 HRS (55 FR 51533, December 14, 1990), Congress, in discussing the substantive standards against which HRS \\nrevisions could be assessed, stated:  \\n \\n10 The EPA maintains dockets for the Site at EPA Headquarters and Region 10, which are available to the public per the \\ninstructions provided in the Federal Register  notice proposing the Site to the NPL (89 FR 16498 March 7, 2024). The \\ndocuments in the EPA Headquarters docket explain the basis for the HRS evaluation of the Site (e.g., the HRS documentation \\nrecord with scoresheets and figures, the narrative summary, etc.) and have been made available online at regulations.gov . The \\ndocuments in the EPA Region 10 docket for the Site include the documents in the EPA Headquarters docket along with all \\nreference documents identified in the HRS documentation record at proposal.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 16   \\nT\\nhis standard is to be applied within the context of the purpose for the National Priorities List; \\ni.e., identifying for the States and the public those facilities and sites which appear to warrant \\nremedial actions…. Th e standard does not require the Hazard Ranking System to be equivalent to \\ndetailed risk assessments, quantitative or qualitative, such as might be performed as part of \\nremedial actions. This standard requires the Hazard Ranking System to rank sites as accur ately as \\nthe Agency believes is feasible using information from preliminary assessments and site inspections.... Meeting this standard does not require long- term monitoring or an accurate \\ndetermination of the full nature and extent of contamination at sites or the projected levels of \\nexposure such as might be done during remedial investigations and feasibility studies. This provision is intended to ensure that the Hazard Ranking System performs with a degree of \\naccuracy appropriate to its role in expeditiously identifying candidate s for respo nse actions . [H.R. \\nRep. No. 962, 99th Cong. 2nd Sess. at 199-200 [1986]]  \\n \\nIn addition, the HRS documentation record at proposal explained that other data that were not used in the HRS \\nscoring of the Site were available and included in the references supporting the HRS documentation record at proposal. These data were not include d in the scoring or in the body of the HRS documentation record itself due \\nto the volume of available data but were available to the public in the HRS documentation record references at the time of proposal. The Site achieved an HRS score sufficient to war rant NPL listing based on the HRS scoring \\npresented in the HRS documentation record at proposal and the cited reference documents used to support that scoring. Additional data were not necessary for the HRS scoring of the Site to achieve and NPL -qualifying site \\nscore but were included in the record for the Site as additional evidence supporting the presence of Site- related \\ncontamination in sediments. Page 76 of the HRS  documentation record at proposal stated:  \\n \\nAdditional Sediment samples confirming an Observed Release by Chemical Analysis :  \\n It should be noted that there are additional sediment samples from the 2019 Teck Phase 3 \\nSediment Study which meet the criteria for an observed release to surface water; however, they \\nwere not included due to the sheer volume of data. These samples were not included because they \\nwere collected near sediment samples already included in documenting an observed release to \\nsurface water. In addition, the current samples and associated data used resulted in a maximized score of the surface water migration pathway. These sediment samples and associated data are \\nincluded in References 35 and 36.\\n \\n Moreover, although these additional data provide supplementary information regarding the Site,  these data were \\nnot necessary to score the Site because the data relied upon sufficiently documented that the Site achieved an \\nNPL -eligible HRS site score of 28.50 or greater. As shown throughout this support document, the comments \\nsubmitted have not identified errors in the HRS factor values that would result in the Site score falling below the listing threshold of 28.50. The Site qualifies for addition to the NP L because it has achieved an HRS score greater \\nthan 28.50, as is demonstrated in the HRS documentation record and this support document. This score is based on the facts presented in the HRS documentation record and this support document. Achieving a site score of \\n28.50 or greater indicates that the Site is eligible for inclusion on the NPL and therefore warrants further \\ninvestigation.  \\n \\nRegarding the citizen ’s comments asserting that data tables  were not provided  at proposal, the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal included data tables summarizing the data relied on to score relevant HRS factors. The HRS documentation record at proposal was made available to the public on regulations.gov at the \\ntime of proposal and in the EPA Headquarters and EPA Region 10 dockets. References supporting the HRS scoring of the Site, including source documents for the analytical data, were identified in the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal’s reference list and were available to the public, upon request, at the time of proposal via the \\nEPA Region 10 Site docket.   \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 17  This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.4 Site Description and Definition \\nComment : Several commenters submitted comments concerning the general description of the Site, and whether \\nthe Site as scored is consistent with prior EPA communications and investigations. TAI commented that the proposed Site is inconsistent with the EPA’s public communications for moving forward with the proposal for adding the Site to the NPL, which have centered on residential soil contamination. TAI commented that, while \\nsoil contamination near Northport was emphasized in communications to the public, the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal instead focused on the concentration of metals in sediment s. TAI stated that “[i]n fact, EPA \\nomitted all but a small portion of the upland areas from the HRS scoring entirely, with the score premised on the Upper Columbia River.”  \\n \\nThe Government of Canada commented that the 2006 Settlement Agreement to conduct the RI/FS and a \\ndescription of the ongoing RI/FS should be included in the HRS documentation record and “introductory \\nremarks.”  \\n Stevens County commented on a perceived difference between the EPA’s communication and the Site as scored, \\nstating:  \\n \\nThe scoring of this proposal is arbitrary and capricious, or at the very least is skewed to fit the desired outcome of NPL listing as a priority site. We have received no communications on \\ncontamination on river sediment, yet the scoring to list this site seems to be based on river \\nsediment data as opposed to the uplands area where lead levels are a little higher and the ninth \\ncircuit court of appeals has ruled that air deposition is not the responsibility of the Tech [sic] \\nsmelter in Canada to clean up and studies have been done. The messaging and purpose of this \\nproposed listing is to clean up the higher lead levels in the Uplands Residential areas where \\nstudies have been conducted and no responsible party exists for clean up of residential properties \\nnear Northport and the Canadian Border.  Yet this messaging to us local governments and citizens \\nthroughout the area was only based on the Uplands data.  \\n Stevens County also asserted that the EPA’s messaging has focused on lead contamination, while the information \\nsupporting the proposed listing of the Site includes other compounds and metals in addition to lead.  \\n \\nResponse: The HRS documentation record at proposal sufficiently described the Site as evaluated for HRS \\nscoring purposes and provided sufficient description for the purpose of identifying the Site for possible NPL placement.  \\n As indicated on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, for HRS scoring purposes, the Site is the release of metals  to the Upper Columbia River and soil from former operations at the two smelters , Cominco and \\nLe Roi. The Site was described on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal as being located in the northeast portion of Washington State and contaminated due to historical disposal and discharges of wastes and \\nemissions from smelter operations, and comingling in soils and surfac e water sediments. Sediments in the river \\nare contaminated with slag and metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc, and a significant quantity of slag still remains in the Upper Columbia River. Upland soils at the Site are \\ncontaminated with metals including arsenic and lead. The HRS evaluation of the Site scored the surface water \\nmigration pathway based on concentrations of hazardous substances in sediments in the Upper Columbia River \\nand the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway based on the concentrations of hazardous substances in soil.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 18  The Site description presented in the HRS documentation record at proposal was intended to describe the Site \\nbased on the information used to complete the HRS scoring of the Site. Page 1 of the HRS documentation record \\nat proposal elaborated on the location and description of the Site explaining that, “[t] he street address, \\ncoordinates, and contaminant locations.… represent one or more locations EPA considers to be part of the site \\nbased on the screening information EPA used to evaluate the site for Nationa l Priorities List (NPL) listing.” The \\ndescription of the Site in the HRS documentation record was also not a final determination of what composes the \\nentire Site, because, as also explained on page 1, “HRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release merely \\nrepresent the initial determination that a certain area may need to be addressed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). ” Regardless of prior descriptions of the \\ncontamination, the subject of this rule making  is the evaluation of the Site for HRS scoring purposes, which is the \\nSite as described in the HRS documentation record at proposal and which meets the HRS definition of a site.   \\nThe Site was properly described  and defined in the HRS documentation record at proposal , consistent with the  \\nHRS.  For HRS purposes, a site is defined in HRS Section 1.1, Definitions, as: \\n  \\nArea(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has \\notherwise come to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area \\nbetween sources.  \\n Page 1 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated that the “EPA lists national priorities among the \\nknown ‘releases or threatened releases’ of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely delineated boundaries.” Page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal described the specific Site and \\nstated that it: \\n \\nincludes for HRS scoring purposes the release of metals from two smelters to the UCR and to soil. The Upper Columbia River site includes three sources: slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter, currently owned by Teck Metals Ltd. (Teck; also referred to \\nin references as Teck American Incorporated [TAI]), to the UCR approximately 10 river miles \\n(RMs) upstream of the international border in Trail, British Columbia (B.C.); and two sources \\n(i.e., contaminated soil and sluice box discharge) associated with the former Le Roi smelter \\nlocated in Northport, Washington.\\n \\n \\nThis description of the Site meets the criteria of a site as defined by the HRS  and adequately describes the \\ncontamination as evaluated in the HRS documentation record at proposal.   \\nAs these comments relate to the communication between the EPA and the public, please see section 3.2, Community Involvement, of this support document for a discussion of comments questioning the level of communication with \\nthe public.  \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.5 Extent of Site \\nComment : Several commenters submitted comments questioning the extent of the proposed Site. Five citizens \\nstated that the Site is too extensive, asserting that the Site should be more specific. One other citizen asserted that the extent of the Site should be reduced and should not include the entire 150 miles of the Upper Columbia River from the U.S.-Canada border to the Grand Coulee Dam. Three  citizens commented that the extent of the proposed \\nSite is inappropriate due to insufficient data to support the d esignation.  \\n \\nTAI, Stevens County, and the Lincoln County Commissioners (Lincoln County) provided comments discussing \\nwhether contamination is present in specific areas. TAI asserted that if placed on the NPL, the Site should be Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 19  limited to the Le Roi/Northport smelter facility. In discussing the ongoing investigations, Lincoln County \\ncommented that “[n]othing of significance has arisen in the lower parts of the lake, all the way to  \\nGrand Coulee Dam.” Stevens County stated that it disagreed that unidentified properties may require remediation.   \\nResponse: The determination of the extent of the Site for HRS scoring purposes was appropriately established and \\ndescribed in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The full extent of site-related contamination, however, is not determined at the listing stage o f the CERCLA  process. The Site  boundaries may change  pending the results \\nof further investigation into where the contamination has come to be located. Placing\\n a site on the NPL is based \\non an evaluation, in accordance with the HRS, of a release or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. However, the fact that the EPA initially identifies and lists the release based on a \\nreview of contamination at a certain parcel of property (or area) does not necessarily mean that the site boundaries \\nare limited to that parcel (or area).  \\n CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(A) requires the EPA to list national priorities among the known “releases or \\nthreatened releases” of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely delineated boundaries. \\nFurther, CERCLA Section 101(a) defin es a “facility” as the “site” where a hazardous substance has been \\n“deposited, stored, placed, or otherwise come to be located.” The “come to be located” language gives the EPA \\nbroad authority to clean up contamination when it has spread from the original source. On March 31, 1989 (54 FR \\n13298), the EPA stated: \\n \\nHRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release merely represent the initial  determination that \\na certain area may need to be addressed under CERCLA. Accordingly, EPA contemplates that the preliminary description of facility boundaries at the time of scoring will need to be refined and \\nimproved as more information is developed as to where the contamination has come to be \\nlocated; this refining step generally comes during the RI/FS stage. [emphasis added] \\n The revised HRS (55 FR 51587, December 14, 1990) elaborates on the “come to be located” language, defining \\n“site” as “area(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has otherwise \\ncome to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area between the sources.”  \\n Until the site investigation process has been completed and a remedial action (if any) selected, the  EPA can \\nneither estimate the extent of contamination at the NPL site, nor describe the ultimate dimensions of the site. Even \\nduring a remedial action (e.g., the removal of buried waste) the EPA may find that the contamination has spread \\nfurther than previously estimated, and the site definition may be correspondingly expanded.  \\n \\nRegarding specific locations with contamination, the Site was defined in the HRS documentation record at proposal based on locations where hazardous substances were located consistent  with the HRS definition of a site. \\nPage 1 of the HRS documentation record at proposal explained that the:  \\n \\ncontaminant locations presented in this Hazard Ranking System (HRS) documentation record identify the general area the site is located. They represent one or more locations EPA considers \\nto be part of the site based on the screening information EPA used to evaluate the site for \\nNational Priorities List (NPL) listing . \\n \\nIn describing the specifics of the Site being scored, page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated \\nthat the Site includes, “ the release of metals from two smelters to the UCR and to soil ” and “three sources.” This \\npage continued that the three sources include:  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 20  slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter  … to the UCR approximately \\n10 river miles (RMs) upstream of the international border in Trail, British Columbia (B.C.); and \\ntwo sources (i.e., contaminated soil and sluice box discharge) associated with the former Le Roi \\nsmelter . \\n \\nPage 14 indicated that the three sources “have been documented to contain metals, including antimony, arsenic, \\ncadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver, zinc, and mercury.” The HRS documentation record at proposal \\nexplained where the contamination is located (in surface water sediments in the Upper Columbia River and in \\nnearby soil) and the specific hazardous substances in the contamination being evaluated. Accordingly, the HRS documentation record at proposal sufficiently identified the extent of the Site f or the purpose of HRS scoring and \\nNPL placement. See also section 3.4, Site Description and Definition, of this support document, for further discussion of the Site description.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.6 Comingled Contamination  \\nComment : TAI commented that inclusion of the Northport area as part of the Site is inappropriate and \\ninconsistent with historical treatment of that area as a separate site. TAI asserted that the EPA’s public \\ncommunications have focused on the soil contamination i n the Northport area which is a separate site unrelated to \\nthe Cominco  smelter. TAI stated that it disagreed with the inclusion of two separate sites as part of the Upper \\nColumbia River site for NPL designation purposes. TAI distinguished the two, s tating that “ the Upper Columbia \\nRiver/Lake Roosevelt Site surrounds the town of Northport, Washington, located approximately 7 river miles downstream of the U.S.- Canada border.” It asserted that Northport has been treated as a separate site in other \\ninstances, such as the exclusion of the Northport area fro m the  RI/FS residential sampling. TAI commented that \\nthe scoring approach used could cause “confusion around what ‘the site’ it aims to list actually is.” TAI disagreed with the scoring of the Site based on comingled contamination, stating: \\n \\nEPA has discretion to score different portions of a site: EPA guidance11 indicates that when \\nmultiple sources are in an area, the EPA Regional Office must decide whether to treat the area as \\none site or as several sites for HRS scoring purposes.6 EPA Region 10 now apparently considers \\nNorthport part of the Upper Columbia River/Lake Roosevelt Site, on the basis that emissions from the Trail smelter 20 miles away have “commingled” with contamination from the former Le \\nRoi/Northport smelter. TAI disa grees with this assertion based on extensive work done as part of \\nthe RI/FS, which shows that, as expected, the material impact of aerial emissions from the Trail \\nsmelter are localized around the smelter in British Columbia and a few miles into Washington .\\n12 \\n[61, 61a, 62] \\n \\nResponse : The HRS documentation record at proposal appropriately evaluated the Site as the comingled \\ncontamination from historical releases associated with the Cominco and Le Roi smelters. While the Site is the comingled contamination from releases from the two smelters, the HRS documentation record at proposal also \\ndocumented that both releases associated with Cominco and Le Roi smelters would independently achieve an \\nNPL qualifying HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately (see Appendix A of the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal). These independent releases from the two smelters comingled in surface water \\nand via air deposition to soil. (See pages 14, 77-78, and 96- 97 of the HRS documentation record at proposal.) \\nTherefore, listing this Site as presented in the HRS documentation record at proposal is consistent with the intent \\n \\n11 TAI cited page 39 of the HRS Guidance Manual.  \\n12 TAI points to TAI, Upper Columbia River Draft Final Remedial Investigation Report for OU 3.

Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 21  of CERCLA as it evaluates the overlapping threat posed by the comingled releases from the former smelter \\noperations.  \\n \\nIn discussing the function of the NPL, CERCLA Section 105 (a)(8)(B) (as modified by SARA) directs the establishment of the NPL:  \\n \\nBased upon the criteria set forth in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the President shall list as \\npart of the plan national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases throughout the \\nUnited States,... In assembling or revising the nationa l list, the President shall consider any \\npriorities established by the states. To the extent practicable, [at least four hundred of] the highest \\npriority facilities shall be designated individually and shall be referred to as the “top priority \\namong known response targets”  \\n Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the National Contingency Plan (NCP) \\ninclude: \\n  \\n[C]riteria  for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United \\nStates for the purpose of taking remedial action and, to the extent practicable, take into account the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action.  \\n To direct implementation of CERCLA (and SARA), the EPA revised the NCP (40 CFR part 300). Section 300.5, Definitions, of the NCP lists the definitions in CERCLA and adds others. It defines the National Priorities List as:  \\n \\nNational Priorities List (NPL) means the list, compiled by EPA pursuant to CERCLA section \\n105, of uncontrolled hazardous substance releases that are priorities for long- term remedial \\nevaluation and response.  \\n \\nThe HRS definition of a site is centered on where contamination has come to be located and may include consideration of more than one area. HRS Section 1.1, Definitions , provides the definition for a site and directs \\nthat a site can include multiple areas. The HRS defines the term site\\n as: \\n \\nArea(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has \\notherwise come to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area \\nbetween sources.  \\n \\nHence, the focus of the listing is on the release and the EPA has scored the overall comingled release from the \\ntwo smelters based on information available for a complete HRS evaluation. In addition, the EPA provided a \\nsupplemental scoring in the HRS documentation record at proposal in Appendix A showing each smelter’s release \\nwould achieve an HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately .  \\n As explained throughout the HRS documentation record at proposal, the Site is the release of metals from the two \\nsmelters ( Cominco  and Le Roi) to the Upper Columbia River and to soil : \\n  \\n• The Site Summary section on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed that the Site includes for HRS scoring purposes the release of metals from two smelters to the Upper Columbia \\nRiver and to soil . It identified that releases from the three scored sources (Cominco slag discharges, Le \\nRoi sluice box discharges, and contaminated soil at the former Le Roi facility) have resulted in comingled \\ncontamination in the Upper Columbia River. It also identified aerial deposition released from both \\nsmelters has become comingled in the AOC soil contamination.  \\n• The Attribution section for the surface water migration pathway on pages 77-78 of the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal discussed the nearly continuous contamination in the 35- mile stretch of Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 22  the river encompassing the zone of contamination scored, and the comingling of the two smelters’ \\nreleases to surface water at and downstream of the Le Roi smelter.  \\n• The Attribution section for the soil exposure component on pages 96-97 of the HRS documentation \\nrecord  at proposal discussed airborne emissions from the two smelters, including operations/emissions \\nfrom Le Roi and air quality/deposition modeling and analysis for emissions from the Cominco smelter to \\nthe greater Upper Columbia River Basin over an 85- year period.  \\n The inclusion  of the Northport area within the scope of  the S ite in the NPL listing is appropriate. The EPA \\nconducted a removal site evaluation of the Le Roi s melter  in 2003 and a removal action in 2004. The RI/FS work \\ndid not begin until after the removal action at Le Roi s melter  began. Thus, the  Le Roi smelter location of the  2003 \\nremoval action was, at that time, considered a separate site. The purpose of the RI/FS for the Upper Columbia \\nRiver site is to determine the nature and extent of contamination, which includes the Le Roi smelter . In 2015, T AI \\ndisputed a direction from  the EPA and, as part of the dispute resolution, the EPA agreed to reduce the area of soil \\nsampling T AI was required to do. The EPA did not require T AI to sample in the Northport town proper in 2016. \\nHowever, the EPA did not exclude Northport from any future sampling or  response action s. \\n As noted above, both the Cominco and Le Roi smelter  releases would independently achieve an NPL qualifying \\nHRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately. While both smelters independently achieve an NPL \\neligible HRS site score, the threat to the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure and subsurface \\nintrusion pathway is the result of comingled releases from the operations at the smelters.   \\n TAI’s claim that aerial emissions from the Cominco smelter are localized around the smelter in British Columbia \\nand a few miles into Washington is incorrect . TAI cites its October 2023 Upper Columbia River Draft Final \\nRemedial Investigation Report for OU 3 as the  basis for  these statements. The EPA disapproved this report on \\nApril 9, 2024, for multiple reasons includ ing TAI ’s mistaken assertions concerning  the geographic limitation of \\naerial metals emissions from the Cominco  smelter.  The full extent of the upland soil contamination is not known, \\nand the EPA is pursuing further investigations.   \\nFinally, even if the comingling of Cominco/Le Roi releases in contamination in the soil at Northport were not \\nconsidered and the soil exposure component were not scored, the Site would still achieve an NPL- qualifying HRS \\nsite score of 28.50 or greater base d solely on the comingled surface water contamination and the surface water \\nmigration pathway score (i.e., the surface water migration pathway yields a pathway score of 100.00, which would result by itself in a site score of 50.00).  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.7 Liability \\nComment: TAI, Stevens County, and two citizens commented on the presence of PRPs and/or liability for the \\ncontamination scored. TAI commented that some of the upland soil contamination along the Upper Columbia \\nRiver is related to impacts from the Le Roi/Northport  smelter and unrelated to the Cominco  smelter and Teck. \\nTAI asserted that as the release associated with the Le/Roi Smelter lacks a solvent PRP, the Site should be limited to the impacts from the Le Roi smelter. TAI commented that following the Settlement Agreement, Teck has made \\ncontinual progress on the RI/FS. Stevens County stated that a PRP is not present for the residential soil \\ncontamination around Northport. Additionally, two citizens commented that involvement from Canada is needed to address the issue as contamination is coming from Canada.  \\n \\nResponse : The NPL listing process is separate from a determination of liability, and liability is not considered in \\nevaluating a site under the HRS. The NPL serves primarily as an informational tool for use by the EPA in identifying those sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health or the environment. Listing a site on \\nthe NPL does not reflect a judgment on the activities of the owner(s) or operator(s) of a site. It does not require Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 23  those persons to undertake any action, nor does it assign any liability to any person. This position, stated in the \\nlegislative history of CERCLA, has been explained more fully in the Federal Register  (48 FR 40674, September \\n8, 1983, and 53 FR 23988, June 24, 1988). See Kent County v. EPA, 963 F.2d 391 (D.C. Cir. 1992  Furthermore, the presence or absence of a PRP (solvent or otherwise) or the absence of involvement from other \\nparties are not factors considered in determining whether to place a site on the NPL . Evaluating whether this Site \\nis eligible for proposal to the NPL is based on the technical analysis set forth in the HRS and explained in the HRS documentation record at proposal. Comments about funding for site remediation are addressed in section \\n3.8, Funding, of this support document.  \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.8 Funding \\nComment: TAI, Stevens County, Benton County, and several citizens submitted comments discussing sources and \\nuses of funding for remedial work.  \\n \\nTAI commented that an RI/FS is ongoing and fully funded. TAI asserted that if NPL designation is pursued, then \\nthe Site should be limited to the Le Roi/Northport smelter due to its lack of a solvent PRP.   \\nTAI asserted that while the EPA’s news release about the proposed addition of the Site to the NPL suggested that \\nNPL placement allows the EPA access to funding via the Superfund program, the process of NPL designation \\nonly makes non- federal sites eligible for federal funding, and that NPL listing makes sites eligible for this funding \\nbut does not guarantee it. TAI commented that: \\n \\n• Only non-federal sites are eligible for funding via the Superfund program following placement on the \\nNPL.  \\n• Other funding mechanisms are required to be pursued by the NCP prior financing remedial actions via the Superfund.  \\n• Actual funding via the Superfund program is determined through specific prioritization factors. \\n• This Site is unlikely to be prioritized for funding due to the limited risk posed by the Site compared other sites.  \\n• Funding, if awarded, may not be immediately available.  \\n \\nStevens County, Benton County, and five  citizens asserted that the motivation behind the pursuit of an NPL \\ndesignation for the Site is to obtain funding. Stevens County stated that it disagreed that adding the entire area to the NPL would result in funding for remedial actions. Stevens County st ated that “references to tapping into IIJA \\n[Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ] dollars” for this Site have been made. Five citizens asserted that \\nincluding this Site on the NPL would be an inappropriate use of tax dollars. One citizen commented that funding should be in the form of grants to allow the community to make improvements that will work at a local level. Five \\ncitizens commented that political power associated with funding is another motivation behind the placement of the Site on the NPL. One citizen asserted that placing the Site on the NPL could become a major cost to \\ntaxpayers. Benton County asserted that the idea that NPL listing will lead to cleanup funding is flawed because it \\nis based on the assumption that public health/environmental concerns will be identified (which is inconsistent \\nwith RI/FS findings so far).  \\n \\nResponse: Insomuch as these comments are related to sources of funding for future or ongoing remedial activities, \\nsources of funding for remedial activities are not a factor considered in evaluating whether the NPL placement of a site is warranted. The costs associated with future or ongoing remedial actions are not determined as part of the Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 24  listing stage of the CERCLA process. The discussion of costs in NPL rules in the Federal Register  clearly states \\nthat including a site on the NPL does not cause the EPA necessarily to undertake remedial action; it does not \\nrequire any action by a private party, nor does it assign liability for site response costs (56 FR 21462, May 9, \\n1991). The cost discussion outlines the EPA’s perception of average potential costs per site that may occur in association with events generally following the proposed listing of a site. Any EPA actions that may impose costs \\non entitie s are based on discretionary decisions and are made on a case-by- case basis. Also, responsible parties \\nmay bear some or all the costs of the RI/FS and subsequent work, or the costs may be shared by the EPA and the \\nStates. Therefore, expenditures cited by the commenter are associated with events that generally follow  listing the \\nsite, not with the listing itself. The EPA has not allocated costs for this Site at this time.   \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.9 Economic Impact and Stigma of Listing \\nComment : Stevens County, Lincoln County, SCBID , QCBID , ECBID , and 21 citizens expressed concern \\nregarding potential economic impacts to the region. In discussing possible economic impacts, Stevens County, QCBID, SCBID, ECBID, and 10 citizens expressed concern for one or more of the following:  \\n \\n• Possible decreases in property values  \\n• Possible changes in taxation and/or shifting tax burdens  \\n• Negative impacts to local business  \\n• Decreases in local tourism and/or local recreation  \\n• Impacts to agriculture and/or global trade markets for food products  \\n The SCBID, QCBID, ECBID, and one citizen also stated that because local farms irrigate crops with water from \\nthe Columbia River, crops from the region may be stigmatized resulting in negative economic impacts to \\nagriculture businesses. The SCBID, QCBID, and ECBID also asserted that the resulting decreases to agriculture businesses could cascade and affect national food supply and/or global trade markets.  \\n \\nIn addition, four citizens commented that economic concerns could occur, asserting  previous economic impacts \\nhave occurred to the local industry (e.g., logging) because  of the protection of the spotted owl as an endangered \\nspecies.  \\n \\nResponse: The EPA notes that there are both costs and benefits that can be associated with listing a site. The \\npotential stigma and economic impacts identified by the commenters, however, are not considered in the \\nassessment of whether a site belongs on the NPL. Such impacts are not the result of NPL listing. Instead, potential negative impacts associated with listing the Site, as noted by the commenter, would be engendered by the \\ncontamination in the area, not by placing the Site on the NPL. Furthermore, inclusion of a site or facility on the \\nNPL reflects the EPA’s judgment that a significant release or threat of release has occurred and that the site is a \\npriority for further investigation under CERCLA.  \\n Among the benefits associated with listing a site are increased health and environmental protection as a result of \\nincreased public awareness of potential hazards. In addition to the potential for federally financed remedial actions, the addition of a site to the NPL could accelerate privately financed, v oluntary cleanup efforts. Listing \\nsites as national priority targets also can give States increased support for funding responses at particular sites. As \\na result of the additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower human exposure to high- risk chemicals, and \\naccess to higher quality surface water, groundwater , soil , and air . Therefore, it is possible that any perceived or \\nactual negative fluctuations in property values, stigma, or development opportunities that may result from \\ncontamination may also be countered by positive fluctuations when a CERCLA investigation and any ne cessary \\ncleanup are completed. For further information, see information in the September 2000 EPA fact sheet, Superfund Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 25  Today, How Can a Superfund Site Affect My Property? (EPA 540 -F-98-001, available at \\nhttps://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/927384.pdf ).  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  \\n3.10 Purpose of Listing \\nComment: TAI, Stevens County, Lincoln County, QCBID, SCBID, ECBID, the Rimrock Cabin Owners \\nAssociation, and several citizens submitted comments discussing the purpose and rationale for listing.  \\n \\nPurpose of NPL Listing  \\nTAI requested that the purpose of listing be clarified, including the benefits and limitations. TAI asserted that \\nstatements have been made that incorrectly suggest that additional enforcement authority is provided via NPL \\nplacement and that these types of  statements provide misinformation about the status of a proposed NPL site. TAI \\ncommented that NPL designation does not provide additional enforcement authority. TAI commented that a Washington State Department of Ecology staff member made a statement sugg esting that an NPL designation for \\nthe Site would end an ongoing litigation.\\n13  \\n \\nTAI stated that an RI/FS is ongoing for this Site in contrast to most sites, which are typically considered for NPL placement at the preliminary assessment (PA) stage. TAI commented that HRS scoring is a site evaluation process \\nintended “for a relatively q uick, limited assessment based on high- level data available in the early days of \\nunderstanding the site.” It asserted that HRS scoring is not intended to account for extensive site- specific data. \\nTAI stated that the HRS Guidance Manual notes that HRS score s are intended to reflect the threat at the time of \\nscoring. TAI commented that the ongoing RI/FS will determine the need for remedial action and the specific \\nactions necessary.  \\n Need for Listing  \\nSeveral commenters provided comments discussing whether a need for listing the Site on the NPL had been established. F ive citizens commented that a need for the proposed NPL designation of the Site had not been \\nprovided. In discussing results of prior investigations, Lincoln County commented that no significant issues have \\nbeen found for lower parts of Lake Roosevelt to the Grand Coulee Dam. A citizen commented that it is unclear \\nwhat remediation of the Site will accomplish.  Three citizens asserted that the designation appeared to be \\nmotivated by the pursuit of funding. Three citizens also commented that a Superfund designation will shift \\npolitical power over a large part of Eastern Washington to the State and local tribes. A citizen asserted that \\nwithout coordination with the Government of Canada, the issue of contamination in the Upper Columbia River \\nwill remain. The QCBID, SCBID, and ECBID asserted that alternative approaches to remediate the soil \\ncontamination that are being identified in the RI/FS should  be pursued. Lincoln County commented that \\nalternatives should be pursued to address issues identified in the lower portion of Lake Roosevelt.   Stevens County asserted that NPL placement of the Site is premature and the process of completing the RI/FS \\nprior to placing the Site on the NPL should be followed. Stevens County commented that the process should also \\nbe followed because the new EPA guida nce on lead levels in soil is inconsistent with the screening levels for \\nmetals in Washington state. Stevens County asserted that placing the Site on the NPL at this time would eliminate the determination of whether remedial work would exacerbate the threat to human health and public safety. It also \\ncommented that NPL placement at this stage would eliminate the examination of which remedial methods are \\nmost appropriate.  \\n \\n \\n13 TAI points to statements made by Brook Beeler, Eastern Regional Manager at the Washington State Department of \\nEcology, as shown in an article from the Roll Call newspaper, available at https://rollcall.com/2024/04/10/superfund- plan-\\nfor-columbia -river -sparks -debate- in-northwest/ .  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 26  One citizen commented that other areas may be in a greater need of remediation and funding for remediation. \\nAnother citizen asserted that listing would cause adverse public health impacts as a result of an economic \\ndownturn.  \\n Remedy Decision/ Remedial Actions  \\nThe Rimrock Cabin Owners Association and 14 citizens submitted comments providing suggested remedial actions. These concerns about future remediation from the Rimrock Cabin Owners Association and the citizens \\nincluded comments that:  \\n \\n• Remediation of the sediment in the Columbia River could lead to a greater exposure to contamination if sediment is disturbed.  \\n• Additional unbiased testing to determine high levels of contamination should occur before remediation begins.  \\n• Documentation that the proposed remedial work will result in improved conditions should be required.  \\n• Unique solutions for remediation and additional planning should be considered.  \\n• Smelters should be shut down and modified.  \\n• Instead of removing the dam, adding fish ladders is a more appropriate mitigation approach and will not impact agriculture in the area.  \\n• Remedial work should be focused on a specific area as opposed to a broader geographic area.  \\n• Remedial work could negatively impact the lake and river area.  \\n• Cleanup should be completed on an area-specific basis accounting for the risk to human health or \\nwildlife.  \\n \\nResponse : The purpose of listing a site on the NPL is to inform the public of a possible threat posed by a site that \\nwarrants further investigation. The EPA’s actions to evaluate the Upper Columbia River site using the HRS and \\nlisting the Site are consistent with the requirements of CERCLA and SARA, and the statutory purpose of the \\nNPL.  \\n \\nPlacing the Site on the NPL is not an announcement of any site- specific risk level or a determination of the need \\nfor remedial action. Listing a site reflects the EPA’s decision to inform the public of the possible threat posed by the site and at a later stage in the CERCLA  process the EPA will determine what, or if, cleanup  action is \\nwarranted. An HRS site score above 28.50 for the Upper Columbia River site represents the EPA’s determination that the Site poses a relative risk as compared to other sites evaluated under the HRS and that the Site warrants further investigation  and potential remediation. At this Site, hazardous substances, including antimony, arsenic, \\ncadmium, chromium, copper, lead, zinc, and mercury, were identified in a release to surface water, and lead and arsenic were identified in contaminated soil ; the relative risk posed by this contamination is reflected in the HRS \\nscoring of the surface water migration pathway and soil exposure component in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The contamination documented in sediments and surface soil has the potential to affect human health \\nand/or the environment. The need for remedial action to address the sediment and soil contamination will be assessed during later stages of the CERCLA process.  \\n \\nPurpose of NPL Listing  \\nThe NPL is generally intended to be a “rough list” of prioritized hazardous sites; a “first step in a process —\\nnothing more, nothing less.” Eagle Picher Indus. v. EPA, 759 F.2d 922, 932 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Eagle Picher II). \\nThe HRS is the mechanism used to evaluate the relative risk of a site. If a site scores 28.50 or greater using the HRS, then it may be added to the NPL.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 27  The purpose of NPL listing is explained in the Federal Register  Notice of February 21, 1990 (Volume 55, \\nNumber 35), excerpted below:  \\n \\nThe purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informational and management \\ntool. The initial identification of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide EPA in \\ndetermining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of the public \\nhealth and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA -financed \\nremedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of si tes \\nEPA believes warrant further investigation.  \\n \\nAddition of the Site to the NPL thus indicates further investigation is warranted to fully assess the extent of risk \\nposed by the Site (and remedial actions may be selected based on the findings of that complete assessment).  \\n Need  for Listing  \\nSufficient basis for placing the Site on the NPL has been established. The Site qualifies for addition to the NPL because it has achieved an HRS score equal to or greater than 28.50, as is demonstrated in the HRS documentation record and this support document. Achieving a site score of 28.50 or greater indicates that the Site  \\nis eligible for inclusion on the NPL and therefore warrants further investigation. Placing a site on the NPL allows the EPA to more effectively prioritize sites and manage possible fut ure site investigations  and response actions; it \\nalso notifies the public that the release at a site is of concern to the Agency. The HRS score for the Site is based on the release of contamination documented in sediment s in the surface water migration pathway and soil \\ncontamination in the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, the \\ncontaminants present, and the targets subject to actual and potential contamination, consistent with th e HRS. The \\nHRS site score above 28.50 presents sufficient need for NPL placement and establishes that the Site poses sufficient relative risk to warrant further investigation.  As explained in detail in section 3.15, Risk to Human \\nHealth and the Environment, of this support document, the HRS evaluation of a site is not a risk assessment and \\nnot intended to provide a specific determination of risk. Rather, the specific risk posed by the Site is determined at \\na separate stage in the CERCLA  process.  \\n Remedy Decision/ Remedial Actions  \\nPlacement of a site on the NPL is not an evaluation of the effectiveness of any remedy currently in place or a \\ndetermination of whether specific remedial actions are appropriate. T he EPA has a procedure for identifying sites \\nwhere releases of substances addressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the \\nNPL, evaluating the nature and extent of the threats at such sites, responding to those threats, and deleting sites \\nfrom the NPL.  The evaluation, or RI/FS phase, involves on- site testing to assess the nature and extent of the \\npublic health and environmental risks associated with the site, and provides information to determine what \\nremedial actions, if any, may be appropriate. After a period of public comment, the EPA responds to those threats \\nby issuing a Record of Decision that selects the most appropriate alternative. The selected remedy is implemented \\nduring the remedial design/remedial action phase. Finally, the site may be  deleted from the NPL when the EPA \\ndetermines that no furt her response is appropriate.  \\n \\nWhile the steps in the CERCLA  process are distinct, they can be conducted in parallel. For the Upper Columbia \\nRiver site, the Site was evaluated using the HRS and received an HRS site score of 51.15, which exceeds the \\nthreshold for placement on the NPL. Because of an NPL eligible HRS site score, in conjunct ion with concurrence \\nfrom the state of Washington , the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation,  and The Spokane Tribe of \\nIndians , the EPA proposed the Site for listing on the NPL. Prior to proposi ng the Site on the NPL, to address the \\nSite in a more timely manner, the EPA has been overseeing the conduct of an RI/FS by a PRP to evaluate the Site \\nin more depth to characterize site contamination and to analyze interim remedial alternatives to address the most \\npressing threats at the Site. The EPA has also conducted or overseen implementation of time critical removal Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 28  actions to address immediate threats to public health.14 As a matter of policy, however, the EPA does not delay \\nNPL listing of a site to incorporate any new data or to score new pathways if the ultimate listing decision is not \\naffected.  \\n \\nAs previously noted in this support document, the selection of remedy—if any is found necessary  for some or all \\nof the Site —and any associated funding is a step carried out at a later stage of the CERCLA  process.  Thus, \\ncomments on a remedy are premature at the listing stage.  However, placing the Site on the NPL does not prohibit \\nany PRP or stakeholder from participating in cleanup efforts  as discussed in detail in section 3.14, Ongoing \\nInvestigation and Remediation, of this support document. The ongoing RI/FS is also discussed further in that \\nsection.  \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.11 Due Process  \\nComment: Stevens County stated that information has been delayed or withheld to move forward with the listing \\nprocess. Stevens County asserted that comments were solicited from select groups on the draft BERA, which is used to support some aspects of the NPL proposal of the Site. It commented that Citizens for Clean Columbia \\nwere provided an opportunity to comment prior to the release of the draft document, while local governments \\nwere not given the same opportunity to comment.  \\n Stevens County also stated that the “solicitation of clean up action contracting for this process under the CERCLA \\nprogram and NPL”\\n15 prior to the proposal to list the Site on the NPL suggests that “this rule- making process has a \\npredetermined outcome without affording the process follow all federal guidelines.” Stevens County quoted the \\nsolicitation, which, in part, states: \\n \\nR10 Upper Columbia River Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7, Acquisition Management Branch, is seeking \\nthe services of an experienced firm to provide Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support services within the Upper Columbia River (UCR) Site. The primary focus of this requirement will \\nbe on residential properties within the Town of Northport that are affected by commingled \\ncontamination from smelter operations.… To achieve this, work includes: 1) an additional round \\nof voluntary soil sampling at properties that have not been previously sampled; 2) complete a \\nremoval assessment and prioritization of properties for cleanup using data obtained during the \\ncurrent and previous sampling events; and 3) conduct time critical removal actions (TCRA) at the \\nproperties identified for cleanup. [A12]  \\n \\nResponse: The EPA correctly followed the HRS, complied with the requirements in the APA, and followed \\nrelevant procedures in determining whether to list  the Site on the NPL. The EPA has concluded that placing the \\nSite on the NPL is an appropriate step in the multi- step CERCLA process.  \\n \\nConsistent with CERCLA, the EPA has in place a procedure for identifying sites where releases of substances \\naddressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the NPL, evaluating the nature and \\nextent of the threats at such sites, res ponding to those threats, and deleting sites from the NPL. The purpose of the \\ninitial two steps is to develop the NPL, which identifies for the States and the public those sites that appear to \\n \\n14 See the Upper Columbia River Study Area webpage ( https://www.epa.gov/columbiariver/upper -columbia -river -study -area) \\ndiscussion in the section titled “Residential cleanups” (as well as planning for future actions in the section “ EPA to conduct \\ntime-critical removal/soil cleanup action ”). \\n15 Stevens County point ed to a solicitation located at: \\nhttps://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2ffedconnect%3fdoc%3d68HE0724R0014%26agency%3\\ndEPA&doc=68HE0724R0014&agency=EPA   Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 29  warrant remedial action (56 FR 35842, July 29, 1991). The evaluation or RI/FS phase involves on- site testing to \\nassess the nature and extent of the public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine \\nwhat alternatives for remedi al action, if any, may be appropriate. After a period of public comment following \\nissuance of the RI/FS and the identification of a preferred alternative, the EPA responds to the identified threats \\nby issuing a Record of Decision which selects the most appropriate alternative. The selected remedy is \\nimplemented during the remedial design/remedial action phase. Finally, the site may be deleted from the NPL \\nwhen the EPA determines that no further response is appropriate.   \\n This process encourages and relies on the participation of the public, including PRPs. The public can comment \\nduring the comment period (typically 60 days) after a site is proposed for listing and during the time the EPA is \\nevaluating and selecting a remed y (the EPA may also hold a public hearing during the latter decision- making \\nperiod). If private parties conduct a remedial action under a consent decree between the EPA and the parties, the \\ndecree is also subject to public comment. The EPA believes that th e above process offers the public sufficient \\nopportunity to present facts and opinions germane to its decision- making.   \\n \\nAdditionally, the CERCLA  process allows the Agency to include expedited removal actions and interim measures \\nto address more immediate concerns or address portions of a site. The EPA may select removal actions (such as a \\nTCRA) at any time to address immediate risks to human health. (See CERCLA Section 10 4.) \\n \\nAs further detailed in section 3.3, Adequacy of Documentation, of this support document, on the subject of the \\nBERA , whether the BERA forms part of the basis for listing and the lack of opportunity for local governments to \\ncomment on the BERA, the HRS evaluation and HRS site score is fully supported by the references in the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal , and the draft BERA is not needed to support the HRS score. The public was \\nprovided a 60- day comment period to review and comment on all documents supporting the listing decision,  \\nincluding the HRS documentation record at proposal and supporting references. The BERA was not included as a  \\nreference to the HRS documentation record at proposal  and is not needed to support the HRS score. Whether \\nanother group may have had an opportunity to evaluate a document not relied upon for the proposed listing of the Site is unrelated to the present listing action.  \\n Regarding the solicitation identified by the commenter (“solicitation of clean up action”), the solicitation \\nsummary quoted above is looking for services to complete Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support \\nservices. Removal action support services can occur separately and be unrelated to the evaluation of whether \\nplacing a site on the NPL is appropriate. As identified in the HRS documentation record at proposal, removal \\nactions have been conducted to address soil contamination in and around the Northport area. The volume of \\ncontaminated soil removed at those locations was not included in the Site for HRS scoring purposes.  Page 92 of \\nthe HRS documentation record at proposal explained that the “EPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area dating back to 2003,” and for the evaluation of “the hazardous waste quantity area \\nand resident population for the AOC … only contaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did \\nnot have soil removals, were included in the calculation.” Thus, this solicitation is unrelated to the HRS \\ndocumentation record and does not impact the site score or affect the assessment of whether placement on the \\nNPL is appropriate.  Note that NPL listing allows for  CERCLA remedial action, which is different from a removal \\naction (i.e., as set out in 42 U.S.C. § 9601(24), a remedial action is generally considered to include those actions \\ntaken that are consistent with a permanent remedy ); also, CERCLA removal actions may occur at any time on \\nsites that are either on , or not on, the NPL.   \\n The solicitation  referred to by the commenter  was issued to ensure that contract services are in place to support \\nadditional removal site evaluation and removal actions , should they be determined to be necessary, at properties \\nwhere potential immediate  risk exists.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 30  3.12 Delay Listing Until the RI/FS is Completed \\nComment: Stevens County, the Eastern Washington Council of Governments (EWCOG), Lincoln County, \\nQCBID, SCBID, ECBID, Benton County, and 22  citizens stated that placement of the Site on the NPL should not \\noccur prior to the completion of an RI/FS or other similar investigation. Stevens County and one  citizen \\ncommented that the EPA previously stated that the Site would not be placed on the NPL until after the RI/FS is \\ncompleted. One citizen asserted that the 2006 settlement agreement with Teck mandated certain studies be completed before NPL listing . [C15] EWCOG stated that, as a high concern is not present, delaying listing “will \\nnot have a detrimental effect.”  \\n \\nStevens County asserted that the RI/FS is ongoing, would be complete in a few years, and should be completed as \\nsoon as possible. Stevens County stated that placing the Site on the NPL after the RI/FS would:  \\n• Ensure “ reliable science- based studies to confirm there is/was an issue needing clean up”  \\n• Identify “specific areas for clean -up where the cleanup action would not create more harm than benefit”  \\n \\nStevens County and several  citizens submitted comments discussing whether the Site should be placed on the \\nNPL prior to the collection of data and information from additional reports. Eight citizens stated that it is unclear \\nwhy NPL designation is occurring without the scientific data that would result from the RI/FS. Stevens County commented that  it is unclear why NPL designation is being pursued for the entire waterbody as an EPA \\nrepresentative indicated that Lake Roosevelt meets drinking water standards except for bacteria, which have not been tested for. Stevens County asserted that pursuing listing prior to completion of the RI/FS would eliminate the \\nassessment of whether remedial efforts may have negative effects and identifying which cleanup methods are \\nappropriate. Stevens County commented that an FS needs to be completed to limit exposure during cleanup. \\nStevens County stated that the RI/FS investigation for ecologic health is funded and that completed human health \\nstudies are indicating no actions a re needed. One citizen commented that the RI/FS will provide information about \\nthe best remedial approach.  \\n \\nIn a letter provided to the EPA included as Attachment A to its comment submission, Stevens County requested \\nthat NPL listing be reconsidered. Stevens County also stated that if the EPA were to pursue an “NPL Listing \\n(Superfund Designation) without completing the RI/FS studies first, you leave us with no other option but to challenge your actions in court.”  \\n \\nResponse : There is no need to delay NPL listing to wait for the results of the RI/FS investigation.  All site \\ninvestigation work performed  to date or currently proceeding, including the ongoing RI/FS, will be considered in \\nsubsequent steps of the CERCLA process. The available information presented in the HRS documentation record \\nat proposal establishes an HRS site score exceeding the 28.50 threshold and qualifying the Site for NPL listing \\nbased on the current conditions at the Site. Site -related contamination remains in sediment s and soil as \\ndocumented in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The EPA has determined that this site- related \\ncontamination appears to warrant further investigation and potential remediation. Other ongoing investigations do \\nnot negate the need for listing. Nevertheless, the results of the Upper Columbia River RI/FS will be taken into account as part of later stages of the CERCLA process for the Site.   \\n As previously indicated in section 3.11, Due Process, of this support document , and  consistent with CERCLA, the \\nEPA has in place a procedure for identifying sites where releases of substances addressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the NPL, evaluating the nature and extent of the threats at such sites, responding to those threats, and deleting sites f rom the NPL. The purpose of the initial two steps is to develop the \\nNPL which identifies for the States and the public those sites that appear to warrant further investigation and \\npotential remedial action. The evaluation or RI/FS phase involves on- site te sting to define the nature and extent of \\nthe threat posed by the contamination and to identify alternatives for remedial action. The RI/FS investigation Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 31  typically occurs following listing on the NPL. (However, as noted in section 3.10, Purpose of Listing, of this \\nsupport document, for this Site, the RI/FS has been ongoing and is proceeding in parallel with NPL listing.)  \\n \\nThus, the purpose of NPL listing is to identify sites warranting further investigation to fully assess the extent of \\nrisk posed by the site (and ultimately to evaluate and determine what CERCLA- financed remedial actions, if any, \\nmay be appropriate). The RI/FS identifies the extent of contamination and possible remedies to address that contamination. In this case, both steps are being done concurrently, as there is a party conducting an RI/FS \\npursuant to a settlement agreement, and, at the same time, there i s sufficient information available to justify NPL \\nlisting.  \\n Regarding the data and documentation used to evaluate and score the Site with the HRS, sufficient data and \\ndocumentation were used for the purposes of HRS scoring as explained in detail in section 3.3, Adequacy of \\nDocumentation, of this support document.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.13 Consistency with Guidance/Use of Guidance \\nComment: TAI and Stevens County submitted comments questioning aspects of EPA guidance documents and \\nthe application of guidance:  \\n \\n• TAI asserted that the HRS Guidance Manual  indicates that, when addressing an area with multiple \\nsources, the EPA can use its discretion to determine whether one or more sites is present for HRS scoring purposes. TAI commented that it disagreed with the EPA’s consideration of the Le Roi  smelter as a part \\nof the Site due to comingling of releases.  \\n• In discussing EPA guidance developed using an extrapolation of Center for Disease Control (CDC) \\nguidance for blood lead levels, Stevens County commented that prior blood lead studies:  \\nshow NO elevated lead levels in children, the most vulnerable population, from the old standards prior to the new guidance. As guidance is simply that and has not been \\navailable for public comment, and extrapolation of data is a scientific guess with no degree [of] certainty, it draws the conclusion that lead levels of blood in the children and \\npopulation in the area should be done prior to scoring being completed to show there is \\nan issue. Scoring should be done on known risks, not guesses by those in the agency.…  \\n• TAI commented on the EPA’s new lead screening level guidance. It pointed to a March 5, 2024, EPA \\nnews release\\n16 in which the EPA noted that soil at more than 194 residential areas related to the Site \\ninvolve lead at levels that exceed the new EPA screening level for residential lead contamination . TAI \\ncommented that guidance for the new screening level does not prescribe cleanup levels (and that site-\\nspecific screening levels are already set).  \\n \\n• TAI asserted that the HRS Guidance Manual indicates that releases are scored based on the threat at the \\ntime of scoring.  \\n \\nResponse : The EPA followed the HRS regulation to list the Site on the NPL. Furthermore, unlike the HRS \\nregulation itself, the HRS Guidance Manual  and other EPA guidance are not regulations and impose no \\nmandatory requirements on the Agency.  \\n \\n \\n16 The news release is available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -wa-\\nsuperfund- list.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 32  Regardless, the Interim Final  HRS Guidance Manual was also applied appropriately in the HRS evaluation based \\non the facts and circumstances known to be present for this Site at proposal; any variation in applying the HRS \\nGuidance Manual  was carried out to reflect site-specific conditions. The  HRS Guidance Manual states that:  \\n \\n[t]he procedures set forth in this document are intended as guidance to employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), States, and other government agencies. EPA officials \\nmay decide to follow the guidance provided in this directive, or to ac t at variance with it, based \\non analysis of specific site circumstances.  \\n In evaluating whether a site merits NPL listing, the EPA complies with the HRS and uses the HRS Guidance \\nManual as just that—guidance to determine how best to perform the HRS evaluation based on the facts or \\ncircumstances presented at each site. The HRS Guidance Manual is consistent with the HRS (this was not \\nchallenged by the commenters), and the EPA has followed the HRS in scoring the Site and applied the  HRS \\nGuidance Manual , as appropriate, depending on the facts presented by this Site.  \\n \\nRegarding the consideration of the Le Roi smelter as a part of the Site due to comingling of releases, the Site was \\nappropriately evaluated as the comingled contamination from historical releases associated with the Cominco and \\nLe Roi smelters  as discussed in detail in section 3.6, Commingled Contamination, of this support document.  \\n Regarding consistency with the draft EPA’s Updated Residential Soil Lead Guidance for CERCLA Sites and \\nRCRA Corrective Action Facilities\\n17 guidance document, this document is intended to only provide \\nrecommendations and present guidance on evaluating sites at stages unrelated to the listing stage of the CERCLA  \\nprocess. This guidance document provides residential soil lead regional screening levels (RSLs) and regional removal management levels (RMLs), which are used during other stages of the CERCLA  process for remedial \\nand removal actions. Further, these screening levels are not used in the HRS evaluation and therefore have no impact on the HRS score.   \\nRegarding the absence of elevated blood lead levels, the HRS does not require blood lead sampling in scoring \\nsites for NPL listing  nor require inclu sion of blood lead levels directly in  any of the HRS factors. Additionally, the \\nEPA also  does  not require , or encourage, blood lead sampling for CERCLA risk assessments as indicated in EPA \\nguidance.\\n18 The EPA ’s mission is to protect human health and the environment by prevent ing adverse health \\neffects from pollution . The EPA does not require evidence of elevated blood lead levels before HRS scoring  of a \\nsite or taking actions to protect human health. Please see section, 3.15, Risk to Human Health and the \\nEnvironment, of this support document for additional discussion of blood lead level studies.  \\n \\nRegarding the comments suggesting that a determination of a specific level of risk associated with the Site be made, as noted above, the Site was evaluated using the HRS regulation which is a screening tool intended to \\nprovide a limited evaluation of a sit e. The determination of site- specific risk occurs at a separate stage of the \\nCERCLA process, and comments discussing the possible risk posed by the Site are addressed in section 3.15, Risk to Human Health or the Environment, of this support document.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.14 Ongoing Investigation and Remediation  \\nComment: TAI, the Government of Canada, and two citizens commented that extensive remediation and \\ninvestigation of the Site have occurred and are ongoing. TAI commented that an RI/FS is ongoing, the BERA is \\n \\n17 Information regarding this EPA guidance document and the purpose of screening levels can be found at \\nhttps://www.epa.gov/superfund/updated -soil-lead-guidance -cercla- sites-and-rcra-corrective- action -facilities .  \\n18 The EPA memorandum , Recommendations for Using Blood Lead Data at Superfund and RCRA  \\nCorrective Action Sites , is available online at https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/11/100000158 . Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n33 ongoing, and the human health risk assessment (HHRA) has been completed. TAI stated that the HRS “ approach  \\nlargely does not account for the extensive RI/FS work already done.” As part of the comments provided by TAI \\non the robust nature of the remedial work Teck has been completing, it commented that:  \\n•Th\\ne HHRA indicated that unacceptable levels of contamination are not present in surface water and fish\\nfrom the Upper Columbia River.\\n•Many of the residential properties with lead -contaminated soil above the EPA action levels have been\\nremediated.\\n•The work completed as part of the ongoing RI/FS included a Tribal consumption and use survey and arecreational use survey.\\n•The draft BERA for the aquatic portion of the Site has been submitted and is a comprehensive aquaticecologic risk assessment\\n•Analysis of thousands of samples from the Site has occurred.\\n•Multiple types of environmental media have been sampled and assessed.\\nTA\\nI and the Government of Canada submitted comments pointing to the ongoing RI/FS. The Government of \\nCanada stated that “[i]t is expected that the results included in these reports will provide essential data on the \\nextent and magnitude of risks as well as identify data gaps for future studies,” and it noted that a hydro-dynamic \\nmodel may provide additional data regarding the transport of slag in the river. The Government of Canada \\nrequested that the nature and extent of the completed and on- going remedial work be clearly stated. TAI also \\nstated that “the nature and necessity of any final remedial action will be determined on a site- specific basis in the \\nRI/FS.” It commented that the aquatic RI report is ongoing and the FS and Records of Decision will occur following the RI.\\n19  \\nAs p\\nart of its comments regarding the extensive remedial work completed for the Site and the evaluation of the \\nSite, TAI asserted that the HRS is an inappropriate tool for evaluating a site with extensive completed remedial \\nwork and available data. TAI stated that while evaluating NPL placement in the early stages of site assessment is \\nappropriate,20 the function of listing to serve as a quick and inexpensive tool21 for assessing sites does not apply to \\na site like the Upper Columbia River, which already has extensive data and an ongoing RI/FS. It commented that unlike this Site where investigation has been occurring for 20 years, NPL placement usually occurs early i n the \\nsite evaluation process. It asserted that NPL placement typically also does not occur where a funded on -going \\nRI/FS is occurring. \\nTA\\nI commented that while the EPA’s stated primary concern is reducing residential exposure to lead in soil, the \\nEPA also noted that NPL listing would not change the process, investigation, or remediation, culminating in the \\nremediation of both upland soil and aquatic areas associated with the Site.22 In discussing the remediation process, \\nTAI commented that an RI/FS is already mandated as part of a Settlement Agreement between EPA and Teck.  \\nResponse : The  EPA has determined that listing the Site on the NPL is the next appropriate step in the CERCLA \\nprocess. Future remedial actions are not considered during the HRS evaluation of the Site because an HRS site score is based on current conditions . Here, the Site warrants placement on the NPL as evidenced by the Site \\nachieving an HRS site score above the listing threshold based on an assessment of the current conditions.  \\n19 TAI pointed to Attachment A of its comment submissi on, which includes a timeline of related RI/FS work.  \\n20 TAI quoted Carus Chem. Co. v. EPA , 395 F.3d 434, 437 (D.C. Cir. 2005) to support the nature of  an NPL designation only \\nensuring additional study.  \\n21 TAI quoted Wash. State Dep’t of Transp. v. EPA , 917 F.2d 1309, 1310 (D.C. Cir.1990) to support that the listing stage of \\nthe CERCLA process is a tool for identifying sites warranting further study.  \\n22 TAI pointed to Attachments B And C of its comment submission, which include copies of the EPA and TAI’s \\npresentations to the EWCOG.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 34   \\nWith regard  to completed remedial work, completed removal  actions have been  considered in the assessment of \\nthe Site.  Although response actions may have been completed and other investigations are ongoing, the Site is still \\neligible for NPL placement, and the conditions at the Site qualify for listing as established by the Site achieving an HRS site score of 51.15. The RI/FS referenced by the commenters is ongoing per a settlement agreement. This \\nsettlement  agreement covers the RI/FS but does not provide  for a potential  site-wide cleanup. However, \\ncompleted response actions and the results of ongoing investigations, including the results of the RI/FS, will be considered in subsequent stages of the CERCLA  process.  \\n \\nAdditionally, numerous completed and ongoing investigations were acknowledged in the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal. Pages 14-16 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed investigations into the \\nUpper Columbia River and associated soil contamination in the Northport area. Page 16 of the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal discussed \\nthat “ numerous EPA Removal activities have occurred in the \\nNorthport, Washington area, including several removal site evaluations (RSEs).”   \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.15 Risk to Human Health and  the Environment \\nComment: TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens submitted comments questioning whether the Site poses a \\nrisk. Stevens County and eight citizens commented that the available studies do not appear to indicate a risk posed \\nby the Site. Stevens County commented that except for bacteria, which have not been tested for, the Columbia \\nRiver meets water quality standards. One citizen commented that tests to determine whether there is a risk posed \\nby metal contamination have not been completed.  \\n \\nIn discussing the risks associated with the Columbia River, nine citizens commented that the water is clean and/or \\nmeets water quality standards. Three  citizens stated that there are no human health risks associated with the Upper \\nColumbia River , the Site  and/or Lake Roosevelt. Eight citizens commented that fish are safe to consume. One \\ncommenter asserted the area is clean except for rubbish.  \\n TAI asserted that there has been a miscommunication whether a human health risk is present associated with the \\nUpper Columbia River. TAI asserted that the Columbia River does not pose a risk based on past reports. TAI \\ncommented that an HHRA has been completed, showing no human health risks. TAI also noted a draft BERA has \\nbeen submitted for the aquatic portion of the Site and is a comprehensive assessment of aquatic ecological risk.  \\nTAI stated that the HRS documentation record at proposal focuses on metal c ontamination in sediments which \\nhas been determined to not pose a risk to human health. Regarding the risk posed by the Upper Columbia River, TAI commented that the river is safe, asserting that:  \\n \\n• The water in the Columbia River is safe.  \\n• The beaches are safe, except for one closed beach.  \\n• The fish from the Columbia River are safe to consume except for largescale suckers.  \\n• The river has a healthy game fishery. \\n• The aquatic portion of the Site does not pose actionable human health risks. \\n• Risk calculations completed in the HHRA determined that contaminants of concern were not associated \\nwith surface water exposure pathways. \\n Commenting on the risk associated with contaminated soil, TAI asserted that, while public communications have \\nconveyed that the Upper Columbia River is safe, the EPA has emphasized a possible human health risk associated \\nwith contaminated soil in the Northport area. TAI commented that a March 5, 2024, EPA news release refers to Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 35  soil contamination as the main risk posed by the Site and pointed to the news releases’ discussion23 of residential \\nareas above the EPA’s new screening level. TAI stated that a human health risk associated with lead in residential \\nsoil has been emphasized and stated that “the potential justification for Listing —if there even is one—is primarily \\ndue to re sidential properties in and around Northport” as opposed to contamination in the Columbia River. \\nRegarding soil contamination, TAI commented that:   \\n• The majority of properties with soil contamination above the action level have been cleaned up.  \\n• The RI and ecological risk assessment for the upland soil contamination is ongoing and close to completion.  \\n• A significant amount of work has been completed.  \\n• The residential soil contamination has been overstated by including non- residential areas in the scope.  \\n• Soil contamination affecting numerous residential properties as a result of the former Le Roi/Northport smelter operations is being addressed via removal and remedial actions.  \\n• Impacted upland soil contamination has been addressed to the current a ction level.  \\n• The potential human health risk is associated with lead in soil in a small portion of the uplands area adjacent to the former Le Roi smelter.  \\n• The impacts of air emissions and dusts from the Le Roi smelter have not been fully assessed and \\ndelineated. \\n In commenting on the risk posed by the Site based on testing of blood levels, Stevens County and EWCOG \\ncommented that local blood testing does not indicate a health concern. Stevens County commented that local \\nstudies do not indicate elevated blood levels in children, which were considered the most vulnerable group under the prior EPA guidance. Stevens County asserted that: \\n \\n• “[I]t draws the conclusion that lead levels of blood in the children and population in the area should be done prior to scoring being completed to show there is an issue.” \\n• “Scoring should be done on known risks.”  \\n \\nAdditionally, two citizens asserted that data from blood lead level testing on children do not support NPL designation.  \\n \\nIn discussing the HRS scoring, TAI commented that the technical reasoning for the proposed listing is \\ninconsistent with past EPA communication regarding the risk posed by the Site. [31] Stevens County stated that \\n“[i]t is hard to know why the scores are so high to warrant listing with no human health risk and data backing up this conclusion.”  \\n \\nResponse : The EPA considers that there is a potential threat to human health and the environment posed by the \\ncontamination in the surface water sediments and soil and that this threat warrants further investigation  and \\npotential further response actions . Consistent with CERCLA, this Site is being placed on the NPL based on an \\nHRS evaluation of the risk relative to other sites being considered for the NPL resulting from the release of \\nhazardous substances to the Upper Columbia River and exposure to contaminated  soil in residential yards.  \\n \\n \\n23 The news release is available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -wa-\\nsuperfund- list. TAI pointed to the following statement in the EPA’s news release, “[t]he agency has determined that soils \\ncontaminated with lead and arsenic pose unacceptable risk to residents at affected properties, particularly to children. EPA \\ndetermined that soil in  at least 194 residential areas contain lead at levels that exceed the agency’s new screening level for \\nresidential lead contamination.”  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 36  The EPA has not assumed site- specific risks are present at this Site in determining that the Site qualifies for \\nplacement on the NPL. The Site achieved an HRS site score above 28.50, which demonstrates that the Site poses \\na sufficient relative risk to warr ant further investigation. The HRS is not a site -specific risk assessment; rather, it \\nis a screening tool used to help the EPA determine priorities for cleanup, and possible response activities, and \\nrepresents relative risk among sites undergoing HRS evaluation. Actual determinations of site -specific risk that is \\nposed to human health or the environment are determined during a different stage of the CERCLA process.  \\n \\nThe NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation, \\npotential further response action, and to  assess the nature and extent of public health and environmental risks \\nassociated with a release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. See 89 FR 16498 (Proposed Rule, \\nUpper Columbia River, March 7, 2024); see also 55 FR 51532 (Final Rule, H azard Ranking System, December \\n14, 1990) and 82 FR 2760 (Addition of Subsurface Intrusion Component to the Hazard Ranking System, January \\n9, 2017). CERCLA § 105(a)(8)(a) requires the EPA to determine NPL priorities among sites based on the \\n“relative risk o r danger to public health or welfare, or the environment.” The criteria the EPA applies to determine \\nthis relative risk or danger is codified in the HRS, and is the Agency’s primary tool for deriving a site score based on the factors identified in CERCLA. The HRS evaluation and score above 28.50 represents the EPA’s \\ndetermination that the Site may pose a relative risk or threat to human health and the environment and warrants \\nfurther investigation under CERCLA. As part of the standard CERCLA  process, once t he Site is on the NPL, the \\ninvestigations performed to date to characterize the Site will be evaluated for completeness, further information will be collected if deemed necessary to adequately characterize the risks posed by the Site, and based on this \\ninformation, a risk assessment decision will be made determining what, if any, remedial action is necessary to \\nprotect human health and the environment.  \\n \\nRegarding comments asserting that there is either no risk or limited risk posed by exposure to soil at the Site, as \\nnoted above the specific risk posed by soil contamination at the site is not determined by an HRS evaluation. \\nWhile risk is typically determined during a later stage of the CERCLA  process , as part of the ongoing RI/FS, \\nsome risk assessment s for portions of the Site  have been completed or started. The full extent of the risk posed by \\nthe Site has not been determined , and the potential risk pose d by the Site  will continue to be evaluated as part of \\nsubsequent stages of the CERCLA process.  Regardless, the HRS evaluation of the Site documented lead and \\narsenic contamination in soil that met observed contamination criteria sufficient for HRS scoring purposes. Additionally, multiple hazardous substances have been documented in surface water se diments to meet HRS \\nrequirements for observed release (antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc), and \\nslag containing hazardous subs tances is documented to have been released directly into the Columbia River. \\nThese hazardous substances present in surface water sediments and in soil are in part attributable to the Site as \\nlisted at proposal.  \\n \\nIn 2021, the  EPA completed the  HHRA at the Site and concluded that risks associated with human exposure to \\ncontaminated soils exceeds risk -based benchmarks on residential and common use properties. The  EPA’s HHRA \\nconcluded that human ingestion of certain fish species, including large -scale suckers, exceed ed risk-based \\nbenchmarks. (See pages 39 and 40 of the HHRA included as Reference 17 of the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal.)  \\n Regarding comments discussing the risk the Site may pose based on the testing of blood lead levels from local \\npopulations, blood lead levels are not required for HRS scoring and not used in an HRS evaluation of a site. \\nSufficient relative risk was established by the Site achieving an NPL eligible HRS site score of 51.15 based on the \\nHRS scoring of the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and \\nsubsurface intrusion pathway.  \\n \\nSee also section 3.14, Ongoing Investigation and Remediation,  of this support document for information related to \\ninvestigation and remedial efforts at the Site, and section 3.2, Community Involvement, of this support document \\nfor discussion of comments about public communications.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 37  This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.16 Regulatory Limits and Screening Levels \\nComment : Several commenters provided comments discussing contamination compared to screening levels and \\nregulatory limits.  \\n \\nWater Quality Several commenters stated there were little to no surface water concentrations that exceeded water quality \\nstandards in the Upper Columbia River. TAI commented that the Upper Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt \\nsurface water data indicated few metals have been detected at concentrations exceeding generic water quality benchmarks and standards. Stevens County stated  that the water in Upper Columbia River  and Lake Roosevelt \\nmeets and exceeds drinking water standards, which makes it hard to understand “ why the s cores are so high to \\nwarrant listing with no human health risk and data backing up this conclusion.” SCBID commented that comprehensive surface water sampling in the Upper Columbia River, including where irrigation water is drawn \\nfrom the river , has yielded results that were all below human health and ecological surface water screening levels. \\nSeveral  citizens commented that the water in Lake Roosevelt meets drinking water standards and with some \\ncharacterizing the situation as “hardly an environmental cata strophe ”; the same commenters  recognized there is \\nmetals contamination in sediment s, but described it as trapped or buried in river sediments. One additional public \\ncommenter stated that tests show most of the lake water meets drinking water standards and most fish are edible with no adverse health issues being reported by those who eat the fish.  \\n One citizen  commented that  while the EPA indicated that there are locations with slag that can lower water \\nquality levels, most people do not use river water for drinking water.  Soil \\nTAI commented  that many residential properties that exceed ed the EPA assigned site- specific action l evel of 700 \\nparts per million (ppm) lead in soil ha ve already been cleaned up. It commented that it is unclear if scoring the \\nupland areas alone would be sufficient to support adding this site to the NPL because these residential properties that exceed the site-specific action level have been cleaned up and the area is sparsely populated. Stevens County commented that all residential properties exceeding prev ious guidance on lead levels have been cleaned up, noting \\nthat lead levels alone do not indicate a need for remedial actions.  \\n \\nMultiple commenters questioned the use and validity of new EPA lead level guidance. TAI asserted  that the \\nexistence of areas with lead concentrations above the EPA’s new screening levels  is not an appropriate basis for \\nadding a site to the NPL. TAI also commented that an action l evel has already been set, a ction has been taken, and \\nthe RI/FS is currently underway to determine the type and necessity of remedial actions. TAI contended that the \\nEPA’s new screening level does not justify listing, as there is no indication that the current action level for the Site is not protective. Stevens County argued that the EPA’s new soil lead screening level guidance is associated \\nwith questions regarding its validity and there is no science-based connection to blood levels in vulnerable \\npopulations. Stevens County also commented that blood studies conducted by the local health district show no \\nelevated lead levels in children, prior to the new EPA lead guidance. Stevens County noted that the new EPA lead \\nguidance, which is not complete yet, will not match the metal levels regulated by the state of Washington. A citizen also claimed that “ EPA changed the levels downward to match the data” because lead levels in the Stevens \\nCounty area were not high enough to support the listing decision.   \\nResponse: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly documented an observed release of metals, \\nincluding antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead zinc, and mercury, to the Upper Columba River based on sediment samples and established the presence of lead and arsenic in soil at concentrations meeting \\nobserved contamination criteria. That releases to the Upper Columbia River and contamination in the soil may be \\nbelow various site, State, or EPA cleanup standards and goals does not eliminate those hazardous substances or Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 38  their releases from consideration when evaluating a site using the HRS.  CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(B) directs the \\nEPA to list on the NPL “releases” of hazardous substances, pollutants and contaminants according to specific \\ncriteria set out in CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(A). The definition of “release” in CERCLA Section 101(22) \\nexem pts certain releases from its scope, but it does not exempt releases below regulatory limits (or \\nscreening/action levels).  \\n \\nThe concentrations of hazardous substances evaluated in the HRS documentation record at proposal were eligible \\nfor consideration consistent with the HRS. On July 16, 1982, when responding to public comments on the \\nproposed (original) HRS (47 FR 31188), and again on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40665), the EPA rejected the \\nidea that releases within regulatory limits should not be considered “observed releases” under the HRS. As the \\nEPA noted in 1982:  \\n \\n[E]mission or effluent limits do not necessarily represent levels which cause no harm to public \\nhealth or the environment. These limitations are frequently established on the basis of economic \\nimpacts or achievability.  \\n \\nBy contrast, an observed release represents a 100 percent likelihood that substances can migrate from the site (47 FR 31188, July 16, 1982). Similarly, observed contamination (the soil exposure counterpart for the HRS observed \\nrelease used in other HRS pat hways) documents that a hazardous substance is present in the surface at \\nconcentrations significantly above background.  \\n Section 2.3 of the revised HRS (55 FR 51589, December 14, 1990) states that an observed release can be \\nestablished either by direct observation or by chemical analysis. An observed release by chemical analysis has \\noccurred when a contaminant is measured si gnificantly above background level if some portion of the release is \\nattributable to the site; observed contamination is documented when a hazardous substance attributable to the site \\nis present at a concentration significantly above background levels for the site within two feet of the surface. \\nAlthough contaminant levels may be lower than regulatory limits, an observed release or observed contamination \\nis nevertheless considered to have occurred if the measured levels are significantly higher than backgro und levels. \\nThe HRS does, however, consider whether releases are above regulatory limits in evaluating target populations, increasing by a factor of 10 the weight assigned populations exposed to contaminants above regulatory limits.  For \\nthis Site, observed releases by both direct observation and chemical analysis were established for the surface \\nwater migration pathway at the Site (see pages 55 -76 of the HRS documentation record at proposal). The \\nobserved release by chemical analysis at this Site was established based on sediment samples collected from the \\nriver. An area of observed contamination was established, as well as Level I targets , for the soil exposure \\ncomponent  of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway (see pages 92 -95 and 108 of the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal).  \\n \\nDocumentation of an observed release or observed exposure and associated HRS likelihood of release/likelihood \\nof exposure factors alone  are not intended to reflect the hazard presented by the particular release. Instead, the \\nhazard of a site is approximated by the total HRS score, which incorporates the likelihood of release/likelihood of exposure factors  with other factors such as waste characteristics (including waste quantity, toxicity, ecotoxicity, \\npersistence, and bioaccumulation) and targets. This tot al HRS score reflects the hazard of the site relative to the \\nother sites that have been scored. A more comprehensive characterization of the contamination, associated releases, and the impacts thereof are fully determined during the RI that typically follo ws listing.   \\n Regarding the commenters’ claim that many residential properties that exceed the EPA assigned site- specific \\naction level have already been cleaned up, the Site has been appropriately evaluated with respect to the response \\nactions  and current conditions. The EPA consider s current conditions, including changes in site conditions due to \\nall removal and remedial activities, when it considers what CERCLA action, if any, is warranted at a site on the \\nNPL. For example, page 92 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 39  [h]owever, since EPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area \\ndating back to 2003 [see Site Summary  section of this HRS documentation record], not all \\nproperties were included within the AOC polygon; for the purpose of determining the hazardous waste quantity area and resident population for the AOC, a conservative approach was taken and only contaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did not have soil \\nremovals, were included in the calculation . [emphasis  added]  \\n \\nRelated to the comments on the use and validity of the EPA’s new lead level guidance, this lead level guidance is \\nnot relevant to HRS scoring or NPL listing; see section 3.13, Consistency with Guidance/Use of Guidance, of this support document for more det ails. Additionally, blood lead levels are not required for HRS scoring and are not \\nused in an HRS evaluation of a site.   \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.17 Other Non-Listing Activities  \\nComment : Several commenters submitted comments discussing activities that are not directly related to placing \\nthe Site on the NPL. \\n \\nThe EWCOG, SCBID, and EBID expressed concern that the proposed NPL placement of the Site could possibly \\nimpact the on -going Columbia River Treaty negotiations between the U.S. Government and the Government of \\nCanada.   \\nStevens County commented that it disagreed with Governor Jay Inslee’s letter of concurrence for the NPL listing of the Site. It asserted that local officials were not consulted or contacted prior to the Governor submitting a letter \\nof concurrence. Stevens County requested that the Governor retract the letter of concurrence. Stevens County also \\nrequested that the Governor discuss the NPL listing with local officials before supporting NPL designation of the \\nSite.  \\n \\nTwo citizens submitted comments discussing  the dam (Grand Coulee Dam) . One commenter opposed listing \\npointing to the need for the nearby dams for hydroelectric power and for agricultural irrigation purposes and noting that the dams have fish passages. A second citizen submitted similar comments, noting the value of the \\ndam for hydroelectric power and irrigation; the commenter stated that if fish are the concern, mitigation of fish \\nmigration pathways should occur via a fish ladder or other alternatives as opposed to removal of the dam.   \\nResponse: Comments presenting  concerns regarding the on -going Columbia River Treaty negotiations, the \\ncoordination efforts between the Governor and local officials , and impacts to the Grand Coulee Dam  have been \\nnoted and are in the public record for the Site. These topics fall outside of the scope of the present listing action; therefore, these comments do not impact the HRS site score or the decision to list the Site on the NPL.  \\n \\nRegarding the Columbia River Treaty negotiations discussed by commenters, these negotiations are handled by \\nthe State Department and are outside the scope of the listing decision. The State Department is involved with \\nthese negotiations and provides additional information for interested individuals on its Columbia River Treaty \\nwebpage ( https://www.state.gov/columbia- river -treaty/ ). \\n Regarding Stevens County’s concerns about the Governor’s concurrence letter  and coordination with local \\nofficials , the Governor of the s tate of Washington supported NPL designation in his letter expressing concurrence \\nwith the EPA’s decision to list the Site on the NPL. The letter of concurrence, in part, states “ [o]n behalf of the \\nstate of Washington, I strongly support the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed listing of the \\nUpper Columbia River (UCR) Site on the National Priorities List (NPL).” Additionally, Stevens County’s Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 40  concerns regarding coordination efforts between the Governor and local officials are outside the scope of the \\npresent NPL listing action.  \\n Additionally, the NPL designation of the Site does not determine the fate of the dam  (the Grand Co ulee Dam ). \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.18 Non-Scoring HRS Documentation Record Comments \\nComment : TAI and the Government of Canada provided comments discussing possible inconsistencies in the \\nHRS documentation record at proposal relating to discussion of slag releases and/or the discussion of a fish advisory study.  \\n \\nRegarding slag releases, the Government of Canada requested that revisions be made in the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal to clarify that these are historical releases that occurred only up through 1996, with the \\nexception of three  accidental releases in 1998. The Government of Canada stated that slag has not been \\ndischarged from the Cominco  smelter since 1998 and requested that the discussion clarify that current effluent \\ndoes not contain slag. The Government of Canada also requested additional revisions related to slag releases, \\nsuggesting changes to the following discussions in  the HRS documentation record at proposal: \\n \\n• The discussion on page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal referring to Cominco’s \\noperations as characterized by frequent accidental releases into the river should be clarified as historical.  \\n• The discussion on page 55 of the HRS documentation record at proposal noting that, “[t]he BC MOE \\nrequired the elimination of slag to the Columbia River by December 1996; however; since this time, \\nCominco has had several releases of slag to the river” should be clarified as historical.  \\n• The discussion on pages 53 and 55 of the HRS documentation record at proposal described probable point \\nof entry ( PPE) 1, associated with the Trail facility, in present tense and PPE2, associated with the Le Roi \\nsmelter, in past tense, even though the Trail facility halted slag releases to the river in 1996 and thus this \\nshould be corrected. \\n• The discussion on page 77 of the HRS documentation record at proposal that refers to “outfalls that \\ndischarge effluent and slag” to the river should be clarified as historical.  \\n• The description of the table on page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal should be revised to \\n“‘Table 1 lists hazardous substances present in Cominco outfall effluent in 199[5/6].’” \\n \\nRegarding the discussion of a Washington State Department of Health (WSDH)  fish advisory (Reference 52 of \\nthe HRS documentation record at proposal), TAI and the Government of Canada commented that the discussion of the fish advisory on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal appear ed to incorrectly discuss the \\nadvisory. TAI asserted that the HRS documentation record at proposal misidentified the origin of a statement identifying Teck as the source of metals in the river in stating “ ‘[a] [Washing ton State Department of Health \\n(WSDH)]  fish consumption advisory Technical Summary (dated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a \\nprimary source of metals and other chemical contaminants in the UCR’ ”; instead of the Washington State \\nDepartment of Health, TAI commented that the origin is actually identified in the advisory document as the EPA. \\nThe Government of Canada questioned the same statement, noting that it appear ed to suggest that Teck is a source \\nof fish advisories associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)  and mercury even though smelters and \\natmospheric sources are identified in the report. The Government of Canada noted that the report refers to Teck because the WS DH used data related to Teck from a fish study. The Government of Canada requested that the \\nstatement on page 84 be revised to clarify the reason for the advisory.   Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 41  Response:  The commenters’ points about possible inconsistencies in the HRS documentation record at proposal \\nhave been noted and are included as a part of the record for the Site because they were submitted to the docket as \\ncomments. While the EPA acknowledges the po ints provided by the commenters, the EPA notes that these \\npossible inconsistencies do not affect the HRS site score or impact the decision to add the Site to the NPL.  \\n \\nThe commenter is correct that the supporting information indicates that slag discharges from Teck were historical, \\nand the EPA does  not dispute these as historical  discharges; this is evidenced by the below items from the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal . Page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal state d, “[s] lag, \\nhistorically  discharged via smelter outfalls to the Columbia River….” [emphasis added] Further, page 31 stated \\n“[t]he B.C. Ministry of Environment, Lands, and Parks required the elimination of slag to the Columbia River by \\nDecember 1996; however, since this time, Cominco has had several releases of slag to the river during upset \\nconditions.” Page 55 stated “Cominco operated four outfalls that have historically  discharged slag and effluent \\ndirectly to the Columbia River .” [emphasis added] The statement regarding frequent accidental releases on HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal page 31 was intended to describe a wider array of spills (only some of which \\ninclude slag), as further detailed on HRS documentation record at proposal pages 55-57. Page 55 provided a \\ntimeline for the releases and specifically stated that not all of the releases involved hazardous substances:  \\n \\nCominco’s operations have been characterized by frequent accidental releases of contaminants into the UCR. On 86 occasions between September 1987 and May 2001, Cominco reported \\nspills of pollutants into the UCR; although not all would necessarily involve hazardous \\nsubstances …. [emphasis added] \\n \\nTable 8 of the HRS documentation record list ed historical spills, only some of which mention slag.  \\n All of  this information indicates that the HRS documentation record at proposal recognized the releases of slag \\nfrom Cominco were , for the most part , historical.  \\n The discussion of PPE1 on page 53 of the HRS documentation record at proposal began  by stating “ Cominco \\noperates outfalls that have historically discharged slag and effluent directly to the UCR” [emphasis added] and \\nsubsequent discussion of PPE1 in the present tense generally involves HRS scoring elements (the HRS probable \\npoint of entry itself, the HRS in- water segment, the HRS target distance limit). PPEs can be historical in nature, \\nand t here are no HRS requirements that PPEs or releases have to be occur ring in the present day to be eligible for \\nHRS listing.  \\n \\nRegarding the paragraph concerning the fish advisory on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal , \\nthe commenter is correct that Teck is not the sole cause of the fish advisory , and the intent of the HRS \\ndocumentation record was not to imply that Teck was the sole cause. T he intent of the associated statements in the \\nHRS documentation record at proposal was simply to note that 1) fish advisories are in place that affect the Upper \\nColumbia River, 2) the advisories are due to both PCBs ( which is not  associated with the Site) and mercury \\n(which is  associated with the Site); and Teck is a significant contributor to contaminants (including contaminants \\nin the river).  \\n On the origin of identification of the Cominco  smelter as a primary source of metals and other chemical \\ncontaminants in the Upper Columbia River, the EPA acknowledges that the commenters are correct and clarifies \\nthat, although the supporting statement is housed in a WSDH document, that document attributes the \\nidentification to the EPA.  \\n \\nBecause these issues do not affect the HRS site score or the decision to list the Site on the NPL, the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal itself will not be revised; however , these clarifications are part of the record for \\nthe Site by virtue of inclusion in this support document.  \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 42   \\n3.19 Hazardous Substance Definition \\nComment : TAI commented that slag is not a CERCLA hazardous substance and is not included in 40 CFR part \\n302, Table 302.4, List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities. TAI also asserted that the solid waste \\ndefinition in 40 CFR 261.4 excludes slag. TAI stated that the hazardous constituent quantity is based only on the \\nmass of CERCLA hazardous substances. TAI asserted that since slag is not a hazardous substance under \\nCERLCA, using slag to determine the hazardous waste quantity for Source 1 is incorrect and misleading.  \\n \\nResponse: Slag is appropriate to use in determining the hazardous waste quantity for a source in the HRS \\nevaluation of a site because it is a source material that contains hazardous substances. Although “slag” is indeed \\nnot itself a CERCLA hazardous substance, it contains CERCLA hazardous substances eligible for HRS scoring, \\nand the hazardous substances within the slag evaluated as part of Source 124 were appropriately associated with \\nthe source. A material need not be a “solid waste” or “hazardous waste” under the 40 CFR Part 261 list for \\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA) to be addressed under CERCLA. \\n HRS Section 1.1, Definitions , defines a hazardous substance for HRS purposes as “CERCLA hazardous \\nsubstances, pollutants, and contaminants as defined in CERCLA Sections 101(14) and 101(33), except where otherwise specifically noted in the HRS.” Additionally:  \\n• CERCLA Section 101(14) defines “hazardous substance” in the context of other f ederal legislation, \\nincluding substances listed pursuant to Sections 307(a) and 311(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (known as RCRA), and Section 112 of the \\nClean Air Act, and substances that are the subject of an action under Section 7 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. It states that a CERCLA “hazardous substance” is:  \\n(A) any substance designated pursuant to section 311(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A)], (B) any element, compound, mixture, \\nsolution, or substance designated pursuant to section 9602 of this title, (C) any hazardous \\nwaste having the characteristics identified under or listed pursuant to section 3001 of the \\nSolid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6921] (but not including any waste the regulation of which under the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.] has been suspended \\nby Act of Congress), (D) any toxic pollutant listed under section 307(a) of the Federal \\nWater Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1317(a)], (E) any hazardous air pollutant listed \\nunder section 112 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7412], and (F) a ny imminently \\nhazardous chemical substance or mixture with respect to which the Administrator has \\ntaken action pursuant to section 7 of the Toxic Substances Control Act [15 U.S.C. 2606]. \\nThe term does not include petroleum, including crude oil or any fract ion thereof which is \\nnot otherwise specifically listed or designated as a hazardous substance under subparagraphs (A) through (F) of this paragraph, and the term does not include natural \\ngas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usa ble for fuel (or mixtures \\nof natural gas and such synthetic gas).”  \\nThus, hazardous wastes as defined under RCRA are only a subset of the broader list of CERCLA \\nhazardous substances.  \\n \\n24 Page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal referred  to the name of Source 1 as “Cominco Outfalls Slag”; \\nhowever, for HRS scoring purposes, Source 1 does not solely consist of slag and is defined as “effluent from outfalls from a \\nlead, silver, and zinc smelter and fertilizer production operation owned by Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada, Ltd.  (Cominco). ” Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 43  • CERCLA Section 102(a) empowers the Administrator to promulgate regulations designating other \\nsubstances as hazardous if when released into the environment they may present substantial danger to the \\npublic health or welfare or the environment. \\n• CERCLA Section 101(33) defines “pollutant or contaminant” as including but not limited to “any \\nelement, substance, compound, or mixture, including disease -causing agents, which after release into the \\nenvironment and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation, or assimilation into any organism, either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through food chains, will or may reasonably be \\nanticipated to cause death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutation, physiological \\nmalfunctions (including malfunctions in reproduction) or physical deformations, in such organisms or \\ntheir offspring.” Substances meeting that definition may also be addressed under CERCLA. \\n \\nThe list of hazardous substances for CERCLA purposes (pursuant to CERCLA Section 102) is maintained in table \\n302.4 of 40 CFR part 302.4.\\n25 This table also notes the particular federal legislation under which each hazardous \\nsubstance is designated.  \\n \\nHRS Section 2.2.2, Identify hazardous substances associated with a source , gives instruction on associating \\nhazardous substances with a source, stating:  \\n \\nFor each of the three migration pathways, consider those hazardous substances documented in a source (for example, by sampling, labels, manifests, oral or written statements) to be associated \\nwith that source when evaluating each pathway. \\n Page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal explained  that hazardous substances are associated with \\nSource 1, Cominco Outfalls Slag. Page 33 stated that: \\n \\n[E]ffluent was not sampled by consultants for EPA. For this reason, hazardous substances listed \\nto be present in outfall effluent are documented by Cominco reports and from outfall releases reported to the B.C. Ministry of Environment, Lands, and Parks by Com inco. \\n \\nTABLE 1 – \\nCominco Smelter – Outfalls \\nHAZARDO US SUBSTANC ES \\nAnalyte Referen ce \\nArsenic Refs. 12, p. 17; 13, pp. 138-139  \\nCadmium Refs. 12, p. 17; 13, pp. 138-139  \\nCoppe r Refs. 11; 13, p. 138  \\nLead Refs. 11; 12, p. 17; 13, p. 140  \\nMercury Refs. 12, p. 17; 13, pp. 139-140  \\nZinc Refs. 11; 12, p. 17; 13, pp. 139-140  \\n In April 2010, a consultant for CCT collected a slag sample (SL4) from the UCR riverbed adjacent to the Cominco smelter… . \\n \\nTABLE 2 –  \\nAPRIL 2010 SLAG SAMPLE RESULTS (mg/kg)*  \\nSlag Sample \\nSL4  <0.063 mm  0.1777 -0.25 \\nmm 0.71-1 mm  1.41-2 mm  2.83-4 mm  Bagged \\nSample  \\nAntimony  93 17 17 7.9 7.2 7.8 \\nArsenic  580 170 160 110 64 86 \\nCadmium  140 73 73 3 2 33 \\n \\n25 The 40 CFR 302.4 list is available at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title -40/chapter -I/subchapter -J/part -302/section -302.4   Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 44  Chromium  41 34 54 59 58 49 \\nCopper  4,200  1,500  1,700  1,500  1,400  1,300  \\nLead  25,000  8,800  7,900  3,700  1,200  3,600  \\nMercury  8.4 0.39 0.086  0.075  0.041  0.088  \\nNickel  40 16 18 22 16 16 \\nSilver  39 11 8.2 5.7 2.6 4.7 \\nZinc  30,000  36,000  36,000  18,000  2,800  16,000  \\nmm = millimeter  \\nmg/kg = milligrams per kilogram  \\n*Ref. 18, p. 74  \\n \\nThus a ntimony, arsenic, cadmium , chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc were \\nassociated with Source 1. These substances are CERCLA hazardous substances based on their specific \\nlisting in the list of CERCLA hazardous substances. The 40 CFR Table 302.4 list of CERCLA hazardous substances includes antimony, arsenic, cadmium , chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and \\nzinc, and shows that each of these particular substances qualifies  as a CERCLA hazardous substance via \\nbeing listed as a t oxic pollutant under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and/or a hazardous air \\npollutant under the Clean Air Act (i.e., via CERCLA 101(14) subparts (D) and (E), respectively). These substances therefore qualify as CERCLA hazardous substances, meet the HRS definition of hazardous substance, and are eligible for HRS scoring. \\n \\nIn addition, the fact that slag \\n as a material does not qualify as a RCRA hazardous waste does not negate \\nthe CERCLA hazardous substance status of the metals in that slag. As noted above, the CERCLA \\ndefinition of hazardous substances includes those substances listed as RCRA hazardous was tes as a subset  \\nof substances that qualify as CERCLA hazardous substances, along with substances listed under the other statutes. Exclusion of a material under one of these statutes does not invalidate the inclusion of the same or related material on one of the other statute’s lists. The courts have understood that RCRA hazardous \\nwastes are only one subset of the broader list of CERCLA hazardous substances. See, e.g., Louisiana-\\nPacific Corp. v. ASARCO, Inc., 24 F.3d 1565, 1572-1573 (9th Cir. 1994); Eagle-Picher v. EPA, 759 F.2d \\n922, 926-931 (D.C.

TAI also stated that slag \\nis not a CERCLA hazardous substance and excluded from the definition of solid waste under 40 CFR 261.4. TAI \\nconcluded that the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity value was incorrectly estimated based on a volume of slag, \\nwhich is not a CERCLA hazardous substance.  \\n \\nResponse: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly assigned a hazardous waste quantity value for \\nSource 1 based on an evaluation of Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity. The HRS documentation record at proposal did not evaluate Tier A, hazardous constituent quantity, for Source 1 as implied by the commenter. \\n \\nH\\nRS Section 1.1, Definitions , defines a hazardous wastestream as “[m] aterial containing  CERCLA hazardous \\nsubstances (as defined in CERCLA section 101[14]) that was deposited, stored, disposed, or placed in, or that otherwise migrated to, a source .” \\n In providing instructions for the source hazardous waste quantity evaluation, HRS Section 2.4.2.1.2, Hazardous \\nwastestream quantity , states:  \\n \\nEvaluate hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) based on the mass of hazardous wastestreams plus the mass of any \\nadditional C ERCLA pollutants and contaminants (as defined in CERCLA section 101[33], as \\namended) that are allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure). For a wastestream that consists solely of a hazardous waste listed pursuant to section 3001 of RCRA, as amended or that consists solely of a RC RA hazardous waste that exhibits the \\ncharacteristics identified under section 3001 of RC RA, as amended, include the mass of that \\nentire hazardous waste in the evaluation of this measure.   \\nBased on this mass, designated as W, assign a value for hazardous wastestream quantity as \\nfollows: \\n• For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for hazardous wastestream quantity using the Tier B equation of Table 2–5…. \\nDo not evaluate the volume and area measures described below if the source is the unallocated source or if the following condition applies: \\n• The hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or \\narea of observed exposure) is adequately determined–that is, total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from \\nthe source (or for the area of observed contamination) is known or is estimated with \\nreasonable confidence…. \\nOtherwise, assign the source (or area of observed contamination) a value for hazardous \\nwastestream quantity based on the available data and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.3. \\n \\nHRS Section 2.4.2.1.5, Calculation of source hazardous waste quantity value , states:  \\n \\nSelect the highest of the values assigned to the source (or areas of observed contamination, areas \\nof observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination) for the hazardous constituent \\nquantity, hazardous wastestream quantity, volume, and area measures. \\n Page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal identified the hazardous substances associated with Source 1. As explained in section 3.19, Hazardous Substance Definition, of this support document, page 33 of the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal include d Tables 1 and 2 , which identify that a ntimony, arsenic, cadmium , \\nchromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc were associated with Source 1.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 46  As part of the discussion of the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity evaluation, page 34 of the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal stated that:  \\n \\nTherefore, there is insufficient information to evaluate the associated releases from the source to calculate the hazardous constituent quantity for Source 1 with reasonable confidence. As a result, \\nthe evaluation of hazardous waste quantity proceeds to the evaluation of Tier B , Hazardous \\nWastestream Quantity . \\n \\nIn discussing the scoring of Tier B, Hazardous Wastestream Quantity, pages 34 and 38 state d: \\n \\nReports that accurately document the yearly and daily amounts of tail slag released to the UCR from the Cominco smelter have not been located. Reports prepared by consultants to Cominco \\nstate that prior to 1995, slag was discharged to the UCR at an average yearly rate of 145,000 \\ntonnes or 159,836 tons (i.e., 145,000 tonnes / 0.90718 tonnes per 1 ton = 159,836 tons) and an \\naverage daily rate of 360 tonnes or 397 tons (i.e., 360 tonnes / 0.90718 tonnes per 1 ton = 397 \\ntons) [Ref. 13, p. 37; Ref. 53, p. 2]. The quantity of slag produced for each year of smelter operation can more accurately be calculated from lead production values. Cominco has reported \\nthat the amount of lead is directly related to the amount of slag produced using the following \\ninformation [R ef. 15, p. 2].  \\n \\nLead production x 140% = amount of blast furnace slag produced.  Amount of blast furnace slag produced x 85% = Amount of slag produced. For example:  \\n \\n- 151,492 tons of lead produced in 1930 x 140% = 212,088.8 tons of blast furnace slag \\n- 212,088.8 tons of blast furnace slag x 85% = 180,275.48 tons of slag produced in 1930 \\n \\nLead production values were obtained from Cominco annual reports [Ref. 3, pp. 3- 20]. Using this \\ninformation, it is estimated that 11,980,922.52 tons or 23,961,845,040 pounds (11,980,922.52 x 2,000 pounds per 1 ton) of tail slag were produced from the Cominco smelter and released to the \\nUCR over the course of operations from 1930 to 1994 as demonstrated in Table 3 below…  \\nBased on the report conducted by a consultant for CCT, it is estimated that 90 percent of the slag discharged to the UCR (between 1930 and 1994) was transported into the U.S. [Ref. 18, p. 5, 87, \\n89, 90]. The value assigned to hazardous wastestream quantity is calculated as follows:  \\n \\n23,961,845,040 pounds x 0.9 = 21,565,660,536 pounds  21,565,660,536 pounds / 5,000 = 4,313,132.10  \\nHazardous Wastestream Quantity (W) Value: 4,313,132.10  \\n[Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.2, Table 2-5] \\n Page 39 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed the source hazardous waste quantity value for \\nSource 1 and stated , “[t] he source hazardous waste quantity value for Source 1 is 4,313,132.10 for Tier B – \\nHazardous Wastestream Quantity .” \\n In calculating the hazardous waste quantity for Source 1, the hazardous wastestream quantity was evaluated and \\nnot the hazardous constituent quantity as implied by the commenter. Page 34 of the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal, quoted above, explained  that because insufficient information was available to calculate Tier A, \\nhazardous constituent quantity, the next tier, Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity , was evaluated instead.  \\n \\nAs described in HRS Section 2.4.2.1.1, Hazardous constituent quantity , t\\n he hazardous constituent quantity is the \\nHRS measure that involves just the mass of hazardous substances (i.e., it is “based solely on the mass of CERCLA  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 47  hazardous substances (as defined in CERCLA  section 101(14)” with some exceptions for certain RCRA wastes). \\nBy contrast, for HRS purposes, a hazardous wastestream  is defined as material that contains hazardous substances, \\nand the mass of that wastestream is the subject of this hazardous waste quantity measure. (See HRS Section \\n2.4.2.1.2, quoted above.) Slag is material containing hazardous substances that are eligible for HRS scoring, as explained in section 3.19, Hazardous Substance Definition, of this support document. Therefore, slag that has been \\nreleased from an outfall is consistent with the HRS definition of a hazardous wastestream.  \\n A\\ns these comments relate to the evaluation of the hazardous waste quantity, Tier B, the hazardous wastestream \\nquantity, was properly determined consistent with the HRS requirements. HRS Section 2.4.2.1.2 directs to \\ncalculate the mass of hazardous wastestreams and to assign a value for the hazardous wastestream quantity \\nregardless of whether it is completely or partially estimated. Using the available data for the mass of slag released (i.e., an HRS- eligible hazardous wastestream), a partial estimate of the mass of the wastestream from the outfall \\n(i.e., the slag) was calculated as 21,565,660,536 pounds. In this case, only the slag discharged to the river and transported to the U.S. part of the river was scored. As quoted above, after applying the divisor in HRS Table 2-5, \\na value of 4,313,132.10 was assigned as a partial estimate of the hazardous wastestream quantity. As directed in \\nHRS Section 2.4.2.1.2, because the “total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from the source” is not known or “estimated with reasonable confidence,” \\nthe evaluation proceeded to Tier C, Volume, in accordance with the HRS.  \\n Furthermore, although the HRS documentation record at proposal assigned the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity \\nvalue based on a partial Tier B (hazardous wastestream quantity) estimate, the Tier C (volume) estimate received the same value. As discussed on page 38 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal also evaluated Tier C, Volume, based on the volume of the slag discharged and carried to the \\nU.S. part of the river , which received the same estimated value of 4,313,132.10. \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  \\n3.21 Surface Water Migration Pathway \\nComment : TAI and three citizens submitted comments questioning aspects of the scoring of the surface water \\nmigration pathway.  \\n \\nResponse: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly scored the surface water migration pathway \\nconsistent with the HRS. Specific comments and responses are provided below in the following subsections:  \\n \\n• 3.21.1 C\\nontainment  \\n• 3.21.2 Attribution \\n• 3.21.3 Waste Characteristics \\n• 3.21.4 Human Food Chain Threat – Targets \\n \\n3.21.1  Containment  \\nComment: TAI and three citizens submitted comments related to containment of contamination. TAI asserted that \\nmetals are releasing from slag at slow rates as indicated by the few metals detected at concentrations above \\nbenchmarks. Two citizens commented that the metal contamination in the Upper Columbia River is buried \\nbeneath sediment. A citizen stated that metals are covered by sediment as indicated by the lack of contamination \\nin bottom feeding fish.  \\n \\nResponse :  Insomuch as these comments pertain to whether the contamination scored is contained, Sources 1, 2, \\nand 3 were determined to be uncontained for HRS scoring purposes. F or HRS scoring purposes, the containment Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 48  of contamination is generally measured at the source and is an evaluation of how well contained hazardous \\nsubstance- bearing source material is from escaping into the environment.  \\n In providing source containment instructions in the surface water migration pathway section, HRS Section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1, Containment , states:  \\n \\nDetermine the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:  \\n• If one or more sources is located in surface water in the watershed (for example, intact sealed drums in surface water), assign the containment factor a value of 10 for the  \\nwatershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1. \\n• If none of the sources is located in surface water in the watershed, assign a containment factor value from table 4 –2 to each source at the site that can potentially release \\nhazardous substances to the hazardous substance migration path for this watershed. \\nAssign the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:  \\n- Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources that meet the \\nminimum size requirement described below. Assign this highest value as the \\ncontainment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1. \\n- If, for this watershed, no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then \\nselect the highest containment factor value assigned to the sources at the site eligible \\nto be evaluated for this watershed and assign it as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1.  \\nA source meets the minimum size requirement if its source hazardous waste quantity value (see \\nsection 2.4.2.1.5) is 0.5 or more. Do not include the minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this surface water migration component, except po tential to release by flood as \\nspecified in section 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.  \\n \\nHRS Table 4 -2, Containment Factor Values for Surface Water Migration Pathway , states in relevant part:  \\n \\nTABLE 4 –2—CO NTAINMENT FACT OR VALUES FOR SURF ACE  WATER \\nMIGRAT ION PATHWAY \\nSource Assigned \\nvalue \\nAll Sources (Except Surface Impoundments, Land Treatment, Containers, and \\nTanks)   \\nEvidence of hazardous substance migration from source areas (i.e., source area \\nincludes source and any associated containment structures) 10  \\nNo evidence of hazardous substance migration from source area and:   \\n(a) Neither of the following present (1) maintained engineer cover, or (2) \\nfunctioning and m aintained run-on control system and runoff management \\nsystem  10  \\n(b) Any one of the two items in (a) present. 9  \\n(c) Any two the following pr esent (1) maintained engineer cover, or (2) \\nfunctioning and m aintained run-on control system and runoff management \\nsystem, or (3) liner with functioning leachate collection and removal system \\nimmediately above liner.  7  \\n(d) All items in (c) present  5  \\n(e) (All items in (c) present, plus no bu lk or non-containerized liquids nor \\nmaterials containing free liquids deposited in source area.  3  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 49  No evidence of hazardous substance migration from source area, double liner with \\nfunctioning leachate collection and removal system above and between liners, and:   \\n(f) Only one of the following deficiencies in containment: (1) bulk or \\nnoncontainerized liquids or materials containing free liquids deposited in \\nsource areas, or (2) no or nonfunctioning or nonmaintained run-on control \\nsystem and runoff management system,  or (3) no or nonmaintained \\nengineered cover.  3  \\n(g) None of the deficiencies in (f) present  \\nSource area inside or under maintained intact structure that provides protection \\nfrom precipitation so that neither runoff nor leachate is generated, liquids or materials containing free liquids not deposited in source area, and functioning \\nand maintain ru n-on control present.  0  \\n \\nIn discussing Source 1, page 32 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  \\n \\nContainment \\n Release to surface water via overland migration:  \\nThe source consists of outfalls that discharged effluent and slag directly to the Columbia River \\n[Ref. 4, p. 26]. A surface water containment value of 10 is assigned based on evidence of \\nhazardous substance migration from the source to the UCR [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. \\n \\nRelease to surface water via flood:  \\n The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it \\ndoes not affect the listing decision. \\n \\nIn discussing Source 2, page 40 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  \\n \\nContainment \\n Release to surface water via overland migration: The source consists of exposed contaminated \\nsoil which does not have a maintained engineered cover or a functioning and maintained run-on \\ncontrol system and runoff management system [Refs. 5, p. 791-792; 38, pp. 68-69, 94; 57, p. 2]. A surface water containment factor value of 10 is assigned [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. \\n Release to surface water via flood:  \\n The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it does not affect the listing decision. \\n In discussing Source 3, pages 46 -47 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated :  \\n \\nContainment  \\n \\nRelease to surface water via overland migration: The source consists of sluice boxes which \\ndischarged slag directly to the UCR. This source does not have a maintained engineered cover or \\na functioning and maintained run-on control system and runoff management system [Refs. 4, pp. \\n22-24; 5, pp. 780-782; 46, pp. 9-10]. During RI activities conducted by a contractor of the \\nWashington State Department of Ecology in 2019, slag was observed in 101 of 138 samples \\nsampled along the UCR waterfront. Most of the obser ved slag was either granular or mixed Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 50  granular and clinker [Ref. 37, pp. 10, 36-38]. Based on this information and the direct discharge \\nto the UCR (evidence of hazardous substance migration from the source to the UCR), a surface \\nwater containment factor value of 10 is assigned [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. \\n \\nRelease to surface water via flood:  \\n The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it \\ndoes not affect the listing decision. \\n \\nSource 1 (Cominco outfalls slag), Source 2 (contaminated soil), and Source 3 (Le Roi sluice boxes discharge) \\nwere assigned containment factor values of 10 because of evidence of hazardous substance migration and/or a \\nlack of containment features  as quoted above. As indicated in the HRS, quoted above, hazardous substances \\nassociated with a source with a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 are considered available to the watershed and included in the Site score because these sourc es are not fully contained. As all three sources \\nwere assigned containment factor values of 10 based on source-specific conditions, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly established that each source is uncontained and the associated contamination, including the Cominco outfalls slag (Source 1) and the Le Roi sluice boxes discharge (Source 3), is available to \\nthe watershed and the surface water migration pathway. For source material that has already migrated into a \\npathway medium— i.e., slag in surface water  sediments for the Site— the HRS scoring factors for the surface \\nwater migration pathway do not consider such characteristics as the rate of hazardous substance leaching from source materials in sediments into the aqueous phase of the water body or sediment cover of the contaminants.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.21.2  Attribution  \\nComment: TAI submitted comments discussing other possible contributors to the contamination scored. TAI \\nasserted that the Other Possible Sources Not Scored section of the HRS documentation record at proposal is \\nincomplete because it does not discuss other possible origins of contamination.  \\n \\nResponse: The Other Possible Sources Not Scored section of the HRS documentation record wa s intended to \\nprovide discussion of other possible sources associated  with the site being scored (i.e., releases from Cominco \\nsmelter and Le Roi smelter) , as opposed to other non- site-related  sources. Insomuch as these comments relate to \\nthe consideration of other possible non- site-related contributors of contamination (contributors other than the \\nreleases from Cominco smelter and Le Roi smelter) in determining appropr iate attribution of the releases scored, \\nsuch contributors were discussed in the Attribution section of the HRS documentation record at proposal, and \\nattribution of the significant increase of hazardous substances to the Site, at l east in part, was properly \\ndocumented for the purpose of scoring an observed release by chemical analysis to surface water.  \\n In presenting the requirements for an observed release by chemical analysis, HRS Section 4.1.2.1.1, Observed \\nRelease, states, in relevant part:  \\n \\nEstablish an observed release to surface water for a watershed by demonstrating that the site has \\nreleased a hazardous substance to the surface water in the watershed. Base this demonstration on \\neither:  \\n• Direct observation .… \\n• Chemical analysis:  \\n- Analysis of surface water, benthi c, or sediment samples indicates that the \\nconcentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the \\nbackground concentration for the site for that type of sample (see section 2.3)…. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 51  • Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to \\nestablish the observed release, except: when the site itself consists of contaminated sediments with no identified source, no separate attribution is required. [emphasis \\nadded] \\n \\nIn describing other possibles sources associated with the Upper Columbia River site (i.e., related to the Cominco \\nsmelter and Le Roi smelter) that were not scored as sources, page 52 of the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal state d:  \\n \\nOther Possible Sources Not Scored  \\n \\nCominco Smelter – Fertilizer Outfall Effluent Discharge  - Fertilizer plants were built at the Trail \\nsmelter in 1930, facilitating the production of both nitrogen- and phosphorous- based fertilizers. \\nOne of the five outfalls associated with the Cominco smelter (i.e., Sewer IV) was used for the fertilizer operati on, which discharged effluent to the UCR. A trend graph of metals in effluents \\nfrom the metallurgical operation from 1980 to 1996 demonstrates that fertilizer plant operation contributed to an average effluent discharge up to 4 kg/d of total mercury and 350 kg/d of dissolved zinc [Refs. 4, pp. 25, 26; 9, pp. 6, 24; 12, p. 18]. The outfall discharge associated with \\nthe fertilizer operation was not scored in this HRS documentation record because the current \\nsurface water m igration pathway score has a maximum pathway score of 100.  \\n This section wa s not intended to address non- site sources unrelated to the Cominco smelter and Le Roi smelter. \\nInstead , the HRS documentation record at proposal described the rationale used to assess attribution for the \\nobserved release in the surface water migration pathway on pages 77 -81. Th is Attribution section  include s on \\npages 78-81 a subsection , Other  Possible Sites, w hich discusses possible contributions of other sources not related \\nto the Site. The Attribution section states:  \\n \\nAttribution  \\n Analytical results from sediment samples collected in September and October 2019 by \\nconsultants of Teck as part of a Phase 3 sediment study document an observed release by \\nchemical analysis to the UCR. The UCR is contaminated with heavy metals from the U.S . Canada \\nborder to RM 708 near Marcus, Washington, an approximate 35- mile stretch of river [see Section \\n4.1.2.1.1 of this HRS documentation record]. Although sediment samples were collected from three areas of concern which are several miles apart, contami nation does exist between these \\nareas. A Phase 2 Sediment study was previously conducted by a consultant of Teck and when this sediment data is combined with the Phase 3 data, the 35 -mile stretch encompassing the zone of \\ncontamination exhibits nearly conti nuous contamination [Ref. 66, pp. 3-162]. Sources associated \\nwith each smelter included in this HRS documentation record [see Section 2.2 of this HRS \\ndocumentation record] have contributed to commingling of metals contamination in the UCR [see \\nSection 4.1.2.1.1 of this HRS documentation record] and impact the targets on the UCR including \\nfisheries, wetlands, and a Federal- designated threatened species habitat [Sections 4.1.3.3.1, \\n4.1.3.3.2.2, and 4.1.4.3.1.2 of this HRS documentation record].  \\n Previous sediment investigations within the UCR have also documented contamination to the \\nUCR from sources associated with both smelters. In 2001, consultants for EPA conducted an \\nexpanded site inspection (ESI) of the UCR.... Analytical results from this investigation indicated \\nwidespread contamination in lake and river sediments throughout the UCR between Inchelium, \\nWashington and the U.S.- Canada border. Arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc \\nwere detected at conc entrations significantly above background sample concentrations, which \\nwere collected from Lower Arrow Lake by the Washington State Department of Ecology [Ref. 4, pp. 66, 71-85]. During this investigation, several sediment samples collected from the UCR Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 52  consisted of a visibly dark glassy sandy mixture characterized by EPA field personnel as slag \\n[Ref. 4, p. 93]. The ESI sampling program also included the collection of sediment samples from \\nthe mouths of 110 tributaries located along the UCR to determine other potential sources of \\ncontamination. Analytical results from tributary samples did not indicate the presence of elevated \\ncontaminants of interest indicative of major watershed sources of contamination [Refs. 4, pp. \\n165-217, 226- 227; 17, pp. 62- 63]. \\n Source 1 (i.e., Cominco Outfalls Slag) is located approximately 10 RMs upstream of the U.S.-\\nCanada border and was scored based on an observed release by direct observation from outfalls \\nthat discharge effluent  and slag contaminated with metals directly to the UCR [see Source 1 \\ndiscussion Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation record]. Although the most upstream scored \\nobserved release sample is located at Deadman’s Eddy, approximately 17 RMs downstream of \\nthe Cominco outfalls, contamination of the UCR does exist between the Cominco facility and the \\nmost upstream scored observed release sample located in Deadman’s Eddy… In 2010, a \\nconsultant for CCT collected sediment samples from the UCR at locations both upstream and \\ndownstream of the Cominco outfalls. Analytical results of sediment samples collected during this investigation indicates that concentrations of these metals increased markedly downstream \\n(compared to sediment samples collected upstream) of the Cominco smelter and remained at \\nelevated levels at four U.S. sampling sites across the U.S. border; the most downstream sample being collected upstream of the Le Roi smelter. Background sediment samples were collected \\nupstream of the Cominco smelter in Genelle and just downstream of the Keenleyside Dam [Ref. \\n18, pp. 58, 72, 74]. In addition, analytical results of a slag sample collected near the Cominco \\nsmelter indicated the presence of metals including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, \\ncopper, lead, nickel, zinc, and mercury [see Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. \\n18, pp. 36, 58, 63, 74].  \\n \\nFrom the Cominco smelter outfalls, metals contamination extends downstream along the UCR \\nwhere it comingles with releases associated with the Le Roi smelter. In 1897, the Le Roi smelter \\nbegan refining copper, lead, and silver ores from mines in northeast W ashington, as well as \\ncopper ore from British Columbia, Canada [Ref. 5, p, 104] …. The smelter was closed and \\ndismantled in 1922, after 24 years of sporadic operation [Ref. 5, p. 105]. During its operation, \\nslag was discharged from the furnaces at the Le Ro i smelter directly into the UCR via \\nunderground waterways, also referred to as sluice boxes (i.e., Source 3) …. Facility maps from \\n1901 and 1908 depict five underground waterways (sluice boxes, grouped as three passage areas) \\ntransporting slag from furnaces to discharge points on the UCR [Refs. 4, p. 24; 46, pp. 9- 10].  \\n \\nIn 2019, an RI of the Northport Waterfront was conducted by a consultant of the Washington \\nState Department of Ecology …. During this investigation, slag materials, (as both clinker and \\nfine granulated particles) were noted to be widespread on the beach, the hillside leading to the UCR as well as in the UCR [Ref. 37, pp. 6, 7, 36- 38]…. \\n \\nThe presence of slag along the shores of the UCR has been documented from Trail B.C., the \\nlocation of the Cominco smelter, to RM 708 in Washington State indicating Cominco and Le Roi \\nsmelters as the sources for this contamination [see Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation \\nrecord].  \\n \\nMetals associated with Cominco smelter and the Le Roi smelter sources were detected at \\nconcentrations significantly above those concentrations detected in background sediment \\nsamples; therefore, at least some portion of the significant increase of these me tals in observed \\nrelease samples in the UCR is attributable to a release from sources associated with both smelters [Table 11; Table 13 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 1, Section 4.1.2.1.1].  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 53  Other Possible Sites  \\n \\nIn addition to contamination from sources (associated with the two smelters) scored in this \\nHRS evaluation, other potential sources of hazardous substances that may have contributed to contamination include mining and milling operations and pulp and paper production [see \\nFigures 2 -1 and 5 of this HRS documentation record]. These contaminant sources are \\nsummarized in the following paragraphs. [emphasis added ] \\n \\nCelgar Pulp Mill - The Celgar Pulp Company (Celgar ) bleach kraft pulp mill is an additional \\nsource of hazardous substance contamination to the Columbia River, however, it is not included \\nas a source in this HRS documentation record since this document has been limited to sources of \\ninorganic contamination and the Celgar mill is instead a source of dioxin/furan contamination. \\nThe Celgar mill is in Castlegar, B.C., approximately 30 RMs upstream from the U.S.- Canada \\nborder [ Figure 2 -1 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 22, p. 20]. From 1961 until mid-1993, \\nthe mill primarily used chlorine in its bleaching process [Ref. 4, p. 31]. The pulp mill discharged \\neffluent containing chlorinated organic compounds, including dioxins and furans, into the Columbia River [Ref. 4, p. 31]. \\n \\nBonanza Mill  - The Bonanza Mill is located approximately 3 miles northwest of Colville, \\nWashington, on the Colville River, a tributary of the Columbia River. The site is a former lead and zinc mill that operated from 1885 to 1952 [Ref. 7, p. 8, 9]. The facility contained a 100-ton flotation mill that processed ore using amalgamation, leaching, and/or flocculation, each of which \\nutilized inorganic elements including mercury [Ref. 7, p. 8]. As a result of milling activities, \\napproximately 17,500 cubic yards o f tailings and waste rock were spread across the facility [Ref. \\n7, p. 11]. Analytical results of tailings/waste rock samples indicate the presence of significant concentrations of arsenic, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 7, pp. 30-31 (Table 6-1)]. Further, analytical results of sediment samples collected \\nfrom the Colville River indicate the presence of lead at an elevated concentration and analytical \\nresults of sediment samples collected from on -site ditches draining to the Colville River indicate \\nthe presence of elevated concentrations of arsenic, barium, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 7, pp. 19, 89, 91- 92, 94, and 95]. After these sampling efforts, consultants \\nfor the EPA conducted a removal action at the facility which included placing 12 to 18 inches of \\neither rock or clay barrier over exposed contaminated mine wastes [Ref. 47, pp. 3, 4]. The \\nBonanza Mill is not believed to be a source of the zone of contamination as scored in thi s HRS \\ndocumentation record, as the Colville River discharges to the UCR downstream of the zone of contamination [Ref. 7, pp. 34, 36]. \\n \\nYoung America Mine/Mill  – The Young America Mine is located approximately 3.6 miles \\nnorthwest of Evans and is accessible from Highway 25 via Hutson Jones Way [Ref. 59, p. 5]…. \\nThe mine portion is located on the eastern side of Highway 25 and is located on land managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The mill and tailings impoundment portion of the \\nsite is located on four privately -owned parcels west of Highway 25 near the UCR. The mine \\noperated between 1897 and 1953, mining zinc, lead, silver, and gold. The flotation mill was built \\n(by Gregor Mines, Inc.) in the late 1940s and operated from 1948 to 1954. Tailings resulting from \\nthe mining operations were discharged downhill towards the west into an impoundment area \\nlocated in the mill portion of  the site …. Laboratory analyses from soil samples collected from the \\nmine and mill portions of the site indicated the presence of lead, arsenic, cadmium, and manganese above EPA Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) [Ref. 59, p. 9]. In 2012, EPA conducted a TCR A to consolidate and cap contaminated soil and tailings in the area around and \\nbelow the mill buildings. Mill buildings were crushed in place, the existing cap was removed on the impoundment and the tailings and contaminated soil were capped with a liner and local \\nmaterial. The TCRA was completed on November 3, 2012 [Refs. 60, p. 2; 61, p. 2]. In the 2021 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 54  HHRA conducted by EPA, it was determined that there was no evidence that contamination \\nmoved down-river from the Young America Mine mill impoundment [Ref. 17, p. 62].  \\n \\nHahnlen Property – The Hahnlen Property is located approximately 3.6 miles northeast of Evans, \\nWA on the east side of Highway 25. The UCR shoreline is located approximately 800 feet west of the property…. Approximately 31,568 square feet of lead- contaminated soil was covered with \\na liner; clean soil from a nearby source was placed on the liner Ref. 58, p. 14].  \\n \\nMines and Mills – Stevens County, Washington  \\n In 2001, EPA conducted PA/SI investigations at 39 mines and mills in Stevens County, \\nWashington. In addition to the Le Roi smelter, four sites were recommended for further action \\nunder CERCLA; an additional site (Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill) was later recommended for further \\naction under CERCLA [Ref. 30, p. 1]. These sites are summarized below: \\n \\nAnderson Calhoun Mine/Mill  \\n The Anderson Calhoun Mine/Mill is located 1 mile north of Leadpoint, Washington, on the west \\nside of Deep Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River [5, pp. 136- 137]. The mine/mill is a former \\nlead and zinc mine/mill that is reported to have been in operation from 1948 to 1952 [Ref. 5, p. 136]. The mine/mill contains a tailings pile measuring 555 feet by 500 feet by an unknown depth, a waste rock pile measuring 120 feet by 80 feet by 20 feet deep, an evaporation pond measuring \\n105 feet by 50 feet, and a mine pit measuring 100 feet by 50 feet [Ref. 5, pp. 6-136, 139]. \\nAnalytical results documented significant concentrations of copper and mercury in the tailings \\npile. Lead and zinc were detected in water from the mine pit [Ref. 5, p. 140]. EPA removal action \\nactivities occurred at the site in 2010 [Ref. 17, p. 68]. The Anderson Calhoun Mine/Mill is not \\nbelieved to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample \\n(TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not \\nexhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215- 216, 227, 451].  \\n \\nLast Chance Mine/Mill  \\n \\nThe Last Chance Mine/Mill is located approximately 5 miles southeast of Northport, Washington, \\nnear Deep Creek, a tributary of the UCR. The facility is a former lead, silver, and zinc mine/mill \\nthat produced 5,937,708 pounds of lead; 18,567 pounds of silver and 110,110 pounds of zinc \\nbetween 1904-1954 [Ref. 5, pp. 30, 114] …. Analytical results of waste rock samples indicate the \\npresence of significant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, thallium, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. \\n175 (Table 6-13), 176, 235 (Figur e 6-24)]. A tailings pile is also present at the facility [Ref. 5, p. \\n115]…. Analytical results of tailings samples indicate the presence of significant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, p. 175 (Table 6-13), 176, 235 (Figure 6-24)]. \\nFurther, an unnamed intermittent creek passes through one of the waste rock piles and the tailings pile as it flows toward Deep Creek [Ref. 5, p. 235 (Figure 6- 24)]. The Last Chance Mine/Mill is \\nnot believed to be a source of contamination to the UCR, a s analytical results from a tributary \\nsample (TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not exhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215-216, 227, 451]. \\n \\nL-Bar/Northwest Magnesite \\n L-Bar/Northwest Magnesite facility is located approximately two miles south of Chewelah, \\nWashington, on the south bank of the Colville River, a tributary of the UCR. The facility is a \\nformer magnesite plant that opened in 1916 and closed in 1968. In the mid-1970s, the facility was \\nconverted to recover magnesium from a magnesium processing byproduct commonly referred to Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 55  as flux bar. The magnesium recovery facility was closed in 1991 [Ref. 5, p. 78]. It has been \\ndemonstrated that flux bar and flux bar residue materials are sources of ammonia and chloride \\n[Ref. 5, p.79]…. The L -Bar/Northwest Magnesite site is not believed to be a source of the zone of \\ncontamination as scored in this HRS documentation record, as the Colville River discharges to \\nthe UCR downstream of the zone of contamination [Ref. 5,pp. 258, 299]. \\n \\nVan Stone Mine/Mill  \\n \\nThe Van Stone Mine/Mill is located approximately 11 miles south of Northport, Washington, on Onion Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River. The facility is a former cadmium, lead, and zinc \\nmine/mill that contains two tailings piles, a waste rock storage area, an open pit, a seepage pond, \\nand stained soil areas [Ref. 5, pp. 94, 96]; Tailings from ore processing were slurried via a \\nwooden flume to pile locations [Ref. 5, p. 95].… Analytical results of tailings samples indicate \\nthe presence of significant con centrations of lead, manganese, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 160-\\n165 (Table 6- 6), 166]. Analytical results of waste rock samples indicate the presence of \\nsignificant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 158-160 (Table 6- 6), \\n166]. Several unnamed creeks flow through the facility grounds to Onion Creek [Ref. 5, pp. 221 \\n(Figure 6 -13), 223 (Figure 6-14), and 262]. Surface water runoff from the tailings piles and the \\nwaste rock area drains to these unnamed creeks [Ref. 5, pp. 221 (Fi gure 6 -13), 262, 223 (Figure \\n6-14)]. Analytical results of a sediment sample collected at the probable point of entry from one \\nof the tailings piles to an adjacent unnamed creek indicate the presence of elevated concentrations of lead and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 167 (Table 6-7), 168 and 223 (Figure 6-14)]. The Van Stone \\nMine/Mill underwent a removal action in 2017 [Ref. 17, p. 68].  The Van Stone Mine/Mill is not \\nbelieved to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample \\n(TS099) collected from Onion Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not \\nexhibit significant concentrati ons of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 213- 214, 227, 450].  \\n \\nSierra Zinc Mine/Mill  \\n \\nThe Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill is located approximately 17 miles south of Northport, Washington, on \\nthe west side of Deep Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River. The mine/mill is a former gold, lead, silver, and zinc mine/mill that operated sporadically from 1909 to 1952 [Ref. 5, pp. 30, \\n124]. The mine/mill contains a tailings pile measuring 1,000 feet by 2,100 feet by approximately 20 feet deep and a waste rock pile measuring 100 feet by 50 feet by 5 feet deep [Ref. 5, pp. 124-\\n125]. Analytical results document significant concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, \\nand zinc in both the tailings pile and the waste rock pile [Ref. 5, p. 126]. The Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill underwent removal actions in 2001 and 2002 [Ref. 17, pp. 67-68]. The Sierra Zinc \\nMine/Mill underwent a removal action in 2017 [Ref. 17, p. 68]. The Van Stone Mine/Mill is not \\nbelieved to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample \\n(TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not \\nexhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215- 216, 227, 451].  \\n \\nMines and Mills – Pend Oreille County, Washington  \\n \\nIn 2001-2002, EPA conducted PA/SI investigations at 21 mines and mills in Pend Oreille County, \\nWashington. During this investigation, a total of five sites were recommended for further action \\nunder CERCLA. Three of the sites have since had their status changed to no further remedial \\naction planned (NFRAP) [Ref. 31, p. 1]. The remaining sites are summarized below:   \\nJosephine Mine  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 56  The Josephine Mine is a former zinc, lead, silver, and cadmium mine located in the Metaline \\nmining district. The mine area consisted of a shaft, a waste rock pile, a small building, and \\ncollapsing wood structure. The mine is located directly across the Pend Oreille River from the \\nPend Oreille Mine/Mill. Analytical results of a sediment sample at the probable point of entry of a waste rock pile to the Pend Oreille River documented significant concentrations of cadmium, \\nlead, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 6, pp. 50-53, 133]. The Josephine Mine underwent a removal \\naction; the site was deemed to have localized contaminant concentrations that met EPA requirements for a removal action; however, the Josephine Mine was not identified as a source of \\ncontamination to the UCR site [Ref. 17, p. 62].   \\nGrandview Mine/Mill  \\n \\nThe Grandview Mine/Mill is located in the lower Pend Oreille River Valley, approximately 0.75 \\nmile from the east bank of the Pend Oreille River, approximately 2 miles northeast of Metaline \\nFalls, Washington. Source areas identified on site included a taili ngs pile, waste rock piles, and an \\nabandoned container and drum area. Analytical results from sampling events conducted in 2000 \\nand 2001 indicated that the Grandview Mine/Mill is a source of hazardous substance \\ncontamination to groundwater drinking water wells, an unnamed spring, a former wastewater \\nditch, and the Pend Oreille River. Contaminants detected at elevated concentrations in a sediment \\nsample collected from the Pend Oreille River included cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc [Ref. 6, \\npp. 52-53, 134-135]. The Grandview Mine/Mill underwent a removal action; the site was deemed \\nto have localized contaminant concentrations that met EPA requirements for a removal action; \\nhowever, the Grandview Mine/Mill was not identified as a source of contamination to the UCR \\nsite [Ref. 17, p. 62]. \\n \\nThus, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly established that the observed release by chemical analysis to surface water was attributable, at least in part, to the Site, and included discussion of other non- site-\\nrelated possible contributors to the contamination. ( The significant increase in hazardous substances compared to \\nthe background level was not challenged by the commenter.) The 11 other possible sites that were identified \\nduring the HRS evaluation were used to help determine that the observed release was attributable, at least in part, \\nto the site as discussed in the Attribution section on pages 77-81 of the HRS documentation record at proposal \\nquoted above.  \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n 3.21.3  Waste Characteristics  \\nComment : TAI stated that the w aste c haracteristics f actor category value, in conjunction with the hazardous waste \\nquantity and t oxicity/persistence /bioaccumulation  factor values, was used to determine a maximum human food \\nchain threat score that likely overestimates the risk posed by the Site. TAI commented that this approach is \\ninconsistent with Site conditions and is not supported by RI/FS data.  \\n TAI commented that the metals in the historically released slag have limited bioavailability. TAI asserted that the \\nslow release rates of metals from slag are evident at the Site, as indicated by the low concentrations of metals in \\nsurface water from the Upper Columbia River.  \\n \\nResponse : The waste characteristics factor category value was correctly calculated in accordance with the HRS in \\nthe HRS documentation record at proposal. The related factor values (i.e., the hazardous waste quantity factor value, toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation) used in the waste characteristics factor category value calculation were also properly assigned in the HRS documentation record at proposal.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 57  In discussing the procedure to evaluate the human food chain threat waste characteristics, HRS Section 4.1.3.2, \\nHuman food chain threat -waste characteristics, states to “[e]valuate the waste characteristics factor category for \\neach watershed based on two factors: toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation and hazardous waste quantity.”  \\n HRS Section 4.1.3.2.2, Hazardous waste quantity , instructs to “[a] ssign  the same factor value for hazardous waste  \\nquantity for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.1.2.2.2 for the drinking water threat. ” HRS Section, \\n4.1.2.2.2, Hazardous waste quantity , in turn states to “[a] ssign a  hazardous waste quantity factor value for  the \\nwatershed as specified in section 2.4.2.” HRS Section 2.4.2, Hazardous waste quantity , in relevant part at 2.4.2.2, \\nstates:   \\n \\nSum the source hazardous  waste quantity values assigned to all sources (including the unallocated \\nsource) or areas  of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface \\ncontamination  for the pathway being evaluated and round this sum to the nearest integer, except:  \\nIf the sum is greater than 0, but less  than 1, round it to 1. Based on this value, select  a hazardous \\nwaste quantity factor value for the pathway from Table 2–6.  \\n \\nTABLE 2 –6—HAZARDOUS WASTE QUANTITY FACTOR VALUES  \\n \\nHazardous waste quantity value  Assigned  \\nvalue  \\n0 0 \\n1a to 100  b1 \\nGreater than 100 to 10,000  100 \\nGreater than 10,000 to 1,000,000  10,000  \\nGreater than 1,000,000  1,000,000  \\na If the hazardous waste quantity value is greater than 0,  but less than 1, round it to 1 as specified \\nin text.  \\nb For the pathway, if hazardous constituent quantity is not  adequately determined, assign a value \\nas specified in the text; do not assign the value of 1.  \\n \\nHRS Section 4.1.3.2.1.4, Calculation of toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value , states how the \\nbioaccumulation potential factor value is used to determine the toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value \\nfor a hazardous substance:  \\n \\nAssign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence factor value from Table 4 –12, based on \\nthe values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and persistence factors. Then assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value from Table 4–16, based on the values assigned for the toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation potential \\nfactors. Use the hazardous substance with the highest toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed to assign the value to this factor. Enter this value in Table 4–1.  \\n HRS Section 4.1.3.2.3, Calculation of human food chain threat -waste characteristics factor category value, \\ndescribes how a bioaccumulation potential factor value is used to calculate a human food chain threat -waste \\ncharacteristics factor category for the watershed:  \\n \\nFor the hazardous substance selected for the watershed in section 4.1.3.2.1.4, use its toxicity/persistence factor value and bioaccumulation potential factor value as follows to assign a \\nvalue to the waste characteristics factor category. First, multiply t he toxicity/persistence factor \\nvalue and the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1x10\\n8. Then multiply this product by the bioaccumulation potential factor value for \\nthis hazardous substance, subject to a  maximum product of 1x1012. Based on this second product, Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 58  assign a value from Table 2 –7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the human food chain threat- waste \\ncharacteristics factor category for the watershed.

However, the HRS states that if any target is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations, assign either the value for Table 2 -6 or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as \\nthe hazardous waste quantity factor value for that pathway [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.2]. Therefore, a hazardous waste quantity factor value of 1,000,000 is assigned for the surface water migration \\npathway.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 59  Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value: 1,000,000  \\n[Ref. 1, Table 2 -6] \\n \\nPage 83 of the HRS documentation record at proposal present ed the waste characteristics factor category value \\ncalculation and stated: \\n \\n4.1.3.2.3 Waste Characteristics Factor Category Value  \\n \\nMercury and cadmium are documented in observed releases and associated with Sources 1, 2, and \\n3, which have a surface water pathway containment factor value greater than 0 for the watershed \\nand correspond to a toxicity/persistence factor value of 10,000 and bioaccumulation potential \\nfactor value of 50,000, as shown above [Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.1.4; 2, pp. 12, 32].  \\n \\n(Toxicity/Persistence Factor Value) x (Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value) =  \\n10,000 x 1,000,000 = 1 x 1010  \\n(Subject to a maximum of 1 x 108)  \\n[Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.3]  \\n \\n(Toxicity/Persistence Factor Value x Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value) x  \\n(Bioaccumulation Potential Factor Value) = (1 x 108) x (50,000) = 5 x 1012  \\n(Subject to a maximum of 1 x 1012)  \\n[Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.3]  \\n \\nThe resulting waste characteristics product of 1 x 1012 corresponds to a Waste Characteristics \\nFactor Category Value of 1,000 in Table 2-7 of the HRS [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.3.1]. \\n \\nThus, the HRS documentation record at proposal evaluated each of the related factor values (i.e., toxicity, \\npersistence, bioaccumulation, and hazardous waste quantity factor values) to determine the waste characteristics factor category value consistent with the HRS. The hazardous waste quantity factor value was based on the \\ncombined sum of the Sources 1 -3 hazardous waste quantity values and HRS Table 2- 6 as presented above in the \\nquoted text from page 82 of the HRS documentation record at proposal. The tox icity, persistence, and \\nbioaccumulation factor values were determined based on an eligible hazardous substance as presented on page 82 \\nof the HRS documentation record at proposal, quoted above. As noted on page 83 of the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal, mercury and cadmium were determined to be the highest scoring hazardous substances with \\nidentical values for toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation. These values associated with mercury and  cadmium \\nwere used to calculate the waste characteristics fact or category value (i.e., 5 x 10\\n12, subject to a maximum of 1 x \\n1012) in accordance with the HRS as presented in calculations on page 83 of the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal.   \\nRegarding the bioavailability of metals in sediments,  the HRS does not consider the bioavailability of hazardous \\nsubstances in an HRS evaluation. \\n \\nRegarding the rate of release of metals from slag to water, for source material that has already migrated into a \\npathway medium— i.e., slag in surface water sediments for the Site— the HRS scoring factors for the surface \\nwater migration pathway do not consider this  rate. That is, HRS scoring does not consider the rate that metals \\nfrom waste material in sediment might dissolve into the water. Therefore, t his type of leaching process is  not \\nconsidered in the HRS site score.  \\n As these comments relate to the risk posed by the Site, please see section 3.15, Risk to Human Health or the \\nEnvironment, of this support document for the discussion of site- related risk.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n60 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n3.21.4  H\\numan Food Chain Threat - Targets  \\nComment: TAI provided comments discussing the level of contamination in fish. TAI commented that a \\nmisleading statement27 is present in the HRS documentation record at proposal that misidentifies the author28 of a \\nfish consumption Technical Summary. TAI asserted that while an advisory acknowledges contamination, the EPA \\ndetermined that fish from the Columbia River are generally safe for consumption. TAI commented that low levels \\nof lead are present in fish species except for largescale suckers, which are not widely consumed. TAI also stated \\nthat hazardous substances unrelated to the Site may be the driver behind fish advisories in place for sensitive groups.  \\nResponse : Insomuch as these comments question the scoring of the human food chain threat of the HRS  and the \\npresence of a human food chain fishery, fishing for human consumption within the zone of actual contamination was sufficiently documented to score the human food chain threat.  \\nHRS\\n Section 4.1.3.3, Human food chain threat- targets, provides instructions for evaluating targets in the \\nhuman food chain threat and states in relevant part:  \\nEval\\nuate two target factors for each watershed: food chain individual and population. For both \\nfactors, determine whether the target fisheries are subject to actual or potential human food chain \\ncontamination. \\nConsider a fishery (or portion of a fishery) within the target distance limit of the watershed to be \\nsubject to actual human food chain contamination if any of the following apply: \\n•A hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater\\nis present either in an observed release by direct observation to the watershed or in a\\nsurface water or sediment sample from the watershed at a level that meets the cr iteria for\\nan observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is\\nwithin the boundaries of the observed release (that is, it is located either at the point of\\ndirect observation or at or between the probable point of e ntry and the most distant\\nsampling point establishing the observed release)….  \\nWhen a fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to actual food chain contamination, determine \\nthe part of the fishery subject to Level I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations. If the actual food chain contamination is based on direct observation, evaluate it \\nusing Level II concentrations. However, if the actual food chain contamination is based on \\nsamples from the watershed, use these samples and, if available, additional tissue samples from \\naquatic human food chain organisms as specified below, to determine the part subject to Level I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations: \\n•Determine the level of actual contamination from samples (including tissue samples from\\nessentially sessile, benthic organisms) that meet the criteria for actual food chain\\ncontamination by comparing the exposure concentrations (see section 4.1.2.3) from these\\nsamples (or comparable samples) to the health -based benchmarks from table 4 -17, as\\ndescribed in section 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use only the exposure concentrations for those\\n27 TAI referred to page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, pointing to the following statement, “[a] WSDH fish \\nconsumption advisory Technical Summary (d ated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a primary source  of metals and \\nother chemical contaminants in the UCR [Ref. 52, p. 1].” \\n28 TAI asserted  that the referen ce document identifies the EPA as the author of the statement, which stat es that “‘[t]he U.S. \\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified the Trail Smelter operated by Teck Cominco (now called Teck) as the \\nprimary source of metals.’” Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 61  hazardous substances in the sample (or comparable samples) that meet the criteria for \\nactual contamination of the fishery.  \\n \\nHRS Section 4.1.3.3.2.2, Level II concentrations, provides instructions for the evaluation a fishery subject to \\nLevel II concentrations. It states:  \\n \\nDetermine those fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to Level \\nII concentrations. Do not include any fisheries (or portions of fisheries) already counted under the \\nLevel I concentrations factor.  \\n \\nAssign each fishery (or portion of a fishery) a value for human food chain population from table \\n4–18, based on the estimated human food production for the fishery. Estimate the human food \\nchain production for the fishery as specified in section 4.1.3.3.2.1.  \\n In describing the targets eligible for scoring in the human food chain threat , page 84 of the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal indicate d: \\n \\n4.1.3.3 Human Food Chain Threat - Targets  \\n The zone of actual contamination is the area of the UCR between the most upstream PPE (PPE1) \\nand farthest downstream observed release sample (EV001 -SED -1-092619). As stated previously, \\ncontamination and targets are not scored for the portion of the UCR loc ated in Canada (i.e., \\nbetween PPE1 and the U.S. -Canada border). Scored contamination and targets are evaluated for \\nthe U.S. portion of the zone of contamination, which encompasses a length of approximately 35 \\nmiles [ Figure 3 of this HRS documentation recor d].  \\n \\nThere is an observed release of metals contaminants to the UCR [see Section 4.1.2.1.1 of this \\nHRS documentation record], which is used for consumption fishing. Species caught for \\nconsumption in the UCR from the U.S.–Canada border to Marcus Washington (and within the \\nscored zone of actual contamination) include walleye, sturgeon, rainbow trout, kokanee, and \\nnorthern pike [Refs. 24, p. 1; 56, p. 1]. The original north boundary of the Colville Indian \\nReservation was the Canadian border; this former “North Half ” of the Colville Indian Reservation \\ncontinues to be an important homeland to the CCT. The CCT exercises certain management and \\nregulatory authority in this area from the northern boundary of the current reservation north to the \\nCanadian border, bounded by the Okanogan and Columbia rivers. CCT -owned land and \\nindividual tribal members reside on the North Half and use the lands, waters, and natural \\nresources for cultural and subsistence uses as they do on the reservation [Refs. 17, p. 61; 20, pp. \\n1-2; 21, pp. 1-2, 4].  \\n The Washington State Department of Health (WSDH) has a fish advisory in place for the \\nconsumption of various fish due to mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concerns. The \\nadvisory covers the portion of the UCR from the U.S.- Canada border to the Grand Coulee Dam. \\nGuidelines are in place for the consumption of species within the UCR including kokanee, lake \\nwhitefish, rainbow trout, white sturgeon, northern pike, burbot, longnose sucker, mountain \\nwhitefish, smallmouth bass, walleye, largescale sucker, a nd largemouth bass. A do- not-eat \\nadvisory is in place for northern pikeminnow [Ref. 23, p. 1]. A WSDH fish consumption advisory \\nTechnical Summary (dated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a primary source of metals \\nand other chemical contaminants in the UCR [Ref. 52, p. 1].  \\n \\nPage 86 of the HRS documentation record at proposal  present ed the scoring of actual contamination associated \\nwith targets in the human food chain threat  and stated: \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 62  4.1.3.3.2.2 Level II Concentrations  \\n \\nThe zone of actual contamination is the area of the UCR between the most upstream PPE (PPE1) \\nand farthest downstream observed release sample (EV001- SED -1-092619)…. The scored zone of \\nactual contamination in the UCR is used for consumption fishing [Refs. 24, p. 1; 56, p. 1]. \\nSpecies caught for consumption in the scored zone of actual contamination include walleye, \\nsturgeon, rainbow trout, kokanee and northern pike [Refs. 24, p. 1, 56. p. 1].  \\n \\nThe food chain production for the fishery is not documented, so based on the aforementioned information, the fishery is assigned to the category “Greater than 0 to 100 pounds per year,” \\nwhich corresponds to the assigned human food chain population value of 0.03 in Table 4-18 of \\nthe HRS [Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.3.2.2]. The available documentation demonstrates that fishing for human consumption occurs within the scored zone of actual contamination delineated by metals \\ndetected in sediment samples at concentrati ons meeting observed release criteria (i.e., \\nsignificantly above background and attributable to the site); therefore, the target fishery is evaluated for Level II actual contamination [ Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 1, \\nSection 4.1.3.3; 24, p. 1]. \\n \\nPage 86 of the HRS documentation record at proposal cited References 24 and 56. Reference 24 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, a phone conversation record with a manager for a fishing tour company, states:  \\n \\nMr. Lawson stated that although the guided tours target rainbow trout, which are caught and released, he knows that the portion of the Upper Columbia River from the U.S- Canada border to \\nMarcus, Washington is fished for consumption. Species caught for consu mption include walleye, \\nsturgeon, rainbow trout and northern pike. \\n \\nReference 56 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, a phone conversation record with a retired professor \\nof biology from Eastern Washington University, states:  \\n \\nProfessor Scholz also informed me that this portion of the UCR (between the U.S.-Canada border and Marcus, WA) is fished for consumption. Species caught for consumption include walleye, red \\nband trout (a type of rainbow trout), kokanee, white sturgeon, and northern pike. He also \\ninformed me that Colville Tribes still fish the UCR for subsistence, including the North Half, \\nwhich fished the upper portion of the UCR between the U.S.-Canada border border [ sic] and \\nMarcus, WA.\\n \\n \\nThus, the HRS documentation record at proposal provided sufficient documentation to support that a human food chain fishery is present at the Site to score a fishery as a target for HRS scoring purposes. Consistent with the \\nHRS instructions regarding identifying a fishery subject to actual human food chain contamination, the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal documented that fish are caught and consumed from within the zone of actual \\ncontamination t o establish that a Level II fishery.  \\n \\nRegarding Reference 52 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, while this reference was used to help \\nprovide context regarding the presence of a fishery as indicated on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal, this reference was not relied on to document a fishery within the zone of contamination at the Site. As \\nnoted above, two records of conversation (one each in References 24 and 56 ) were used to document the presence \\nof a human food chain fishery within the zone of contamination. See section 3.18, Non -Scoring HRS \\nDocumentation Record Comments, of this support document for clarifications related to Reference 52 and associated HRS documentation record text.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 63  3.22 Soil Exposure Component  \\nComment: TAI and Stevens County commented that it is unclear whether scoring the upland soil contamination \\nwould achieve an NPL eligible score. TAI asserted that it is also unlikely that the soil contamination would \\nachieve a sufficient HRS site score as properties above the Action Level have been remediated and the area is \\nrural.  \\n \\nTAI and Stevens County provided comments questioning whether the areas with contaminated soil were \\nappropriately evaluated and considered residential. TAI asserted that the extent of the residential soil \\ncontamination described in general EPA communications is overstated because non -residential land use areas are \\nincluded. Stevens County commented that areas categorized as residential for scoring also include forest, industrial, and commercial areas. It stated that EPA representatives have alluded to the ar ea as residential even \\nthough many of the sampling areas are zoned as forest. It commented that it could identify where residential \\ndevelopment may occur. It asserted that the other non- residential areas that have been sampled are not eligible as \\nresidenti al areas for scoring or eligible under the soil lead guidance. Stevens County concluded that the resulting \\nscoring of these non- residential areas is incorrect.  \\n TAI asserted that the soil contamination, as opposed to the entire Upper Columbia River site, appears to be the \\npossible justification for placing the Site on the NPL. TAI acknowledged that the soil contamination may involve properties below future cleanup levels, but also stated that the presence “of some areas with lead concentrations \\nabove EPA’s new screening levels is not an appropriate basis for Listing a particular site.”  \\n \\nResponse: Insomuch as the commenter’s assertions are related to the evaluation of the soil exposure component, \\nthe soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway was properly scored in \\naccordance with the HRS in delineating an AOC. Further, when an HRS score is calculated, each individual \\npathway does not need to achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score, as the HRS site score is based on a \\ncombination of the individual pathway scores. In this case, the HRS evaluation of the Site included the surface \\nwater migration pathway in addition to the soil exposure component in scoring, and the Site achieved an NPL \\neligible HRS site score of 51.15 , which is above the minimum threshold for NPL placement. \\n \\nThe commenters’ specific points regarding scoring the soil exposure component, property types, and soil sample \\nconcentrations do not affect or invalidate the HRS site score:  \\n \\n• On the subject of what properties are eligible for consideration in the delineating the AOC, the AOC is \\ndelineated based on samples meeting observed contamination criteria. T he HRS does not  restrict observed \\ncontamination to a specific property type.  \\n• On the subject of the pathway- specific score achieved by the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, \\nthe HRS does not require that an individual pathway independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score.  \\n• On the subject of the presence of properties with soil contamination below an action level, residents may be eligible for scoring in the soil exposure component even if located at properties with soil sample \\nconcentrations below an action level.  \\n \\nIn presenting the instructions for determining eligible soil contamination, HRS Section 5.1.0, General considerations , states:  \\n \\n• Establish areas of observed contamination based on sampling locations at which there is  \\nobserved contamination as follows.  \\n- For all sources except contaminated soil, if observed contamination from the site is \\npresent at any sampling location within the source, consider that entire source to be an \\narea of  observed contamination.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 64  - For contaminated soil, consider both the sampling location(s) with observed \\ncontamination from the  site and the area lying between such locations to be an area of \\nobserved contamination, unless  available information indicates otherwise.  \\n• If an area of observed contamination (or portion of such an area) is covered by a permanent, \\nor otherwise maintained, essentially impenetrable material (for example, asphalt) that is not \\nmore  than 2 feet thick, exclude that area (or portion of the area) in evaluating the soil \\nexposure  component.  \\n• For an area of observed contamination, consider only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria  for observed contamination for that area to be associated with that area in \\nevaluating the soil exposure  component (see section 2.2.2).  \\n Further instructions for assessing the resident population threat are presented in HRS Section 5.1.1, Resident \\npopulation threat . This section states:  \\n \\nEvaluate the resident population threat only if there is an area of observed contamination in one or more of the following locations:  \\n• Within the property boundary of a residence, school, or day care center and within \\n200 feet of the respective residence, school, or day care center, or  \\n• Within a workplace property boundary and within 200 feet of a workplace area, or  \\n• Within the boundaries of a resource specified in section 5.1.1.3.4, or  \\n• Within the boundaries of a terrestrial sensitive environment specified in section 5. 1.1.3.5 \\n[emphasis added]  \\n \\nFor assessing the targets factor category, HRS Section 5.1.1.3, Targets , instructs a scorer, in part, to:  \\n \\nEvaluate the targets factor category for the resident population threat based on five factors: \\nresident individual, resident population, workers, resources, and terrestrial sensitive \\nenvironments.  \\nIn evaluating the targets factor category for the resident population threat, count only the following as targets:  \\n• Resident individual – a person living or attending school or day care on a property with \\nan area of observed contamination and whose residence, school, or day care center, \\nrespectively,  is on or within 200 feet of the areas of observed contamination.  \\n• Worker – a person working on a property with an area of observed contamination and \\nwhose  workplace area is on or within 200 feet of the area of observed contamination.…  \\n \\nIn describing the scoring of the AOC, page 92 of the HRS documentation record at proposal state d:  \\n \\nAOC A is defined by a polygon bounded by soil contamination meeting HRS observed contamination criteria (i.e., locations showing lead and arsenic at concentrations significantly \\nabove published background levels and collected from the top 2 feet of soil) … However, since \\nEPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area dating back to 2003 [see Site Summary section of this HRS documentation record], not all properties were \\nincluded within the AOC polygon; for the purpose of deter mining the hazardous waste quantity \\narea and resident population for the AOC, a conservative approach was taken and only \\ncontaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did not have soil removals, were \\nincluded in the calculation ….

The AOC was determined \\nbased on soil samples meeting observed contamination criteria for lead and/or arsenic as specified in HRS Section \\n5.1.0. The commenter has not challenged the evaluation of whether particular samples used to delineate the AOC \\nmet observed contamination criteria. In accordance with the instructions in HRS Sections 5.1.0, 5.1.1, and 5.1.1.3, \\nand as presented on pages 92, 100, 102, 103, 107, and 108 of the HRS documentation record at proposa l, quoted \\nabove, eligible residents were determined based on either inferred contamination on residences being located \\nwithin the AOC or samples meeting observed contamination criteria that were collected on the property and \\nwithin 200 feet of a residence. Thus, the HRS documentation record at proposal identified eligible residents \\nduring the evaluation of the population associated with eligible residences consistent with the HRS requirements.  \\n \\nThe HRS does not require that an individual pathway independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score. The \\nHRS site score, which takes into account the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway score, is greater than the NPL placement threshold of 28.50 making this Site eligible for placement on the NPL. The soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathw ay score of 21.66 does not independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score; \\nhowever, per HRS Section 2.1.1, Calculation of HRS site score , an HRS site score is calculated using the pathway \\nscores from all four pathways for the Site. At this Site, the surface water migration pathway was also evaluated \\nand received a pathway score of 100.00. Following the HRS methodology and accounting for the scores from the \\ntwo pathways scored, the resulting HRS site score is 51.15 making the Site eligible for NPL placement. The rationale for placing the Site on the NPL is in part due to the Site achieving an NPL eligible HRS site score based \\non the evaluation of both the surface water migration and the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway s \\nconsistent with the HRS requirements for scoring a site.   \\nRegarding the consideration of the  action level in determining eligible samples and residents, as explained above \\nin section 3.16, Regulatory Limits and Screening Levels, of this support document, contamination below an action \\nlevel or other screening level may still be eligible for consideration in documenting observed contamination. The \\nHRS uses the criteria for observed contamination as specified in HRS Section 5.1.0, quoted above, to evaluate the soil exposure component. As explained above, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly determined \\nwhich soil samples met observed contamination criteria, which is not challenged by the commenter. Residences and associated residents were also correctly calculated as explained above.  \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n4. Conclusion \\nThe original HRS score for this site was 5 1.15. Based on the above responses to public comments, the score \\nremains unchanged. The final scores for the Upper Columbia River site are:  \\n \\nGround Water:      Not S cored  \\nSurface Water:       100.00 \\nSoil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion:   21.66 \\nAir Pathway:       Not S cored  \\nHRS Score:       51.15 \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAttachment A  \\nLetter from Jarred Michael Erickson, Chairman, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \\nReservation to Casey Sixkiller, EPA Region 10 Administrator.

The Colville Tribes supports placement \\nof the UCR Site on the NPL. \\nThe UCR Site includes areas within the traditional homeland, and current Reservation, of the Colville \\nTribes. Historical disposal and discharges of wastes and emissions from smelter operations have \\ncontaminated the UCR Site and pose a risk to human health as well as to the sovereignty and economic \\nsecurity of the Colville Tribes. \\nAs you correctly note in your letter, the Colville Tribes has worked for at least two decades to address the \\nlegacy of contamination at the UCR Site, including litigation with our partners in the federal government, the \\nState of Washington, and the Spokane Tribe of Indians. An NPL listing will allow access to resources that \\nare much needed for remediation of the UCR Site. \\nThe Colville Tribes appreciates and accepts your offer to coordinate with our staff as the NPL listing \\nprocess proceeds. Thank you for this effort to bring maximum resources to this remediation as quickly as \\npossible. \\nchael Erickson \\nChairman \\nConfederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation OLEM/OSRTI \\nWashington, DC 20460 \\nNATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST (NPL) \\n***Proposed NPL Site*** September 2024 \\nHISTORIC POTTERIES Trenton, New Jersey \\nMercer County \\n\\uf0feSite Location: \\nThe Historic Potteries site consists primarily of residential, public school, and public park properties in or around the East \\nTrenton and Top Road neighborhood in the city of Trenton, Mercer County, New Jersey, although commercial and industrial \\nproperties may also be contaminated. \\n\\uf0a1Site History: \\nThe pottery industry was prominent in Trenton, with a major hub in the East Trenton and Top Road neighborhoods. The \\nindustry grew from the 1850s until the 1920s, when more than 50 potteries operat ed simultaneously; products included \\ntableware, art ceramics, sanitary ware, and electrical porcelain. Residential development of the area coincided with the industrial activity. The pottery industry began to shrink considerably during the Great Depression; as it waned, some of the \\nhistoric pottery locations were converted to additional residential property. Lead was commonly used in glazes that were \\nsubject ed to very high temperatures in the firing kilns, causing lead to be released into the air via the kiln exhaust and then \\nsettle onto soil downwind from the kilns. Soil containing ceramic pieces was likely used as fill material during residential \\ndevelopment and may also be a source of lead contamination. In 2018 the State of New Jersey and City of Trenton notified \\nthe EPA that the neighborhood of East Trenton was contaminated with lead. \\n\\uf090Site Contamination/Contaminants: \\nSoil is contaminated with lead at levels that exceed the Removal Management Level (RML). \\n\\uf094Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment: \\nThe soil contamination potentially affects 542 intermediate school students and their faculty and administrators, as well as at \\nleast 226 residents in the East Trenton and Top Road neighborhoods. \\n\\uf050Response Activities (to date): \\nThe EPA began investigating a former solder manufacturer in East Trenton in 2018 and found elevated lead levels on nearby \\nresidential properties. However, the EPA determined that the lead contamination was not caused by the solder manufacturer. \\nBeginning in 2020, the EPA performed extensive research and a field investigation to determine whether the former potteries caused lead contamination in the soil. The EPA began sampling residential properties, schools, and parks within the Top Road and East Trenton neighborhoods in 2023. Upon discovery of lead contamination on school property, the EPA started work \\nwith the school district to develop a plan that would protect the school community from lead contamination in the soil. School \\nofficials have closed play areas, and the EPA installed temporary protective covers over the impacted areas. Additional \\nremoval actions are anticipated to address lead contaminated soil at residential properties and parks in East Trenton. \\n\\uf09bNeed for NPL Listing: \\nIn 2020 the State of New Jersey requested that the EPA evaluate the site for a removal action and possible inclusion on the \\nNPL because of the lead contamination that was discovered in East Trenton. Other federal and state cleanup response \\nprograms were evaluated but are not viable at this time because of the potential ly large number of properties that will require \\ncleanup and the significant resources need ed to continue to characterize the contaminated areas. In June 2024 the State \\nnominated the site for inclusion on the NPL. \\n[The description of the site (release) is based on information available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS. The description may \\nchange as additional information is gathered on the sources and extent of contamination. See 56 FR 5600, February 11, 1991, or subsequent \\nFR notices.] \\nFor more information about the hazardous substances identified in this narrative summary, including general information regarding the effects of exposure to \\nthese substances on human health, please see the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) ToxFAQs.

The affected properties include a school \\nwith a student population of 542 and full -time faculty level of 45, and 84 occupied residential properties with an \\nestimated total population of 2 26.96 [see Section 5.1. 1.3 of this HRS documentation record ]. Figure 1 of this HRS \\ndocumentation record presents a Site Location Map showing former pottery locations and approximate known \\nextent of the contaminated soil AOC , Figure s 1a and 1b of this HRS documentation record present the background \\nsampling locations used for defining the AOC, Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record shows the site study \\narea and the locations of properties sampled by EPA, and Figures 3 through 3i of this HRS documentation record \\nprovide additional d etail regarding the AOC including sampling locations and levels of contamination . \\nThe Historic Potteries site is in the East Trenton and Top Road neighborhoods of Trenton, Mercer County, New \\nJersey [Refs. 3, p. 1; 6, pp. 10, 13] . In 2018 , EPA began an investigation in East Trenton and found lead levels \\nabove the EPA Removal Management Level (RML) on residential properties [Refs. 6, p. 6; 11, p. 1; 12, pp. 5 –6]. \\nDue to the histor y of the area, where numerous industrial -scale potteries formerly operated, EPA began investigating \\nthe pottery industry as the potential source of the elevated lead levels in 2020 [Refs. 6, p p. 8–11; 7, pp. 2 –5; 11, p. \\n1; 12, p. 5] . Through its research, EPA identified a bout 80 locations throughout Trenton where one or more potter y \\nmanufacturing businesses had formerly operated; about half of these locations housed large -scale operations and \\nmore than 30 were located in and around the East Trenton/Top Road area [Refs. 6, pp. 8 –10]. These industrial -scale \\npotteries operated in the area over variable timeframes between the 1850s and the mid-20th century [Refs. 6, p. 10; \\n7, pp. 2 –5; 8, p. 2; 9, pp. 1, 3; 37, p. 5 ; 44, pp. 1, 6 –39]. In 1850, just one industrial pottery was operating in Trenton \\n[Ref. 7, p. 4; 8, p. 2; 44, p. 37]. However, t he industry grew increasingly prominent in the city from the 1850s until \\nthe 1920s (in 1924, more than 50 facilities were operating simultaneously in Trenton), when it began to shrink \\nconsiderably during the Great Depression [Refs. 7, pp. 4 –5; 8, p. 2; 9, p. 1; 10, p. 3; 38, pp. 74 –76; 44, pp. 6 –42]. \\nThe reasons for the growth of the pottery industry in Trenton from the 1850s until the 1920s were the city’s central \\nlocation with respect to markets ( New York and Philadelphia ) and its role as a hub in the regional transportation \\nnetwork of canals and railroads [Refs. 6, p. 8; 7, p. 4 ; 43, p p. 1, 3]. The surge of industrial pottery development \\noccurred primari ly along the Delaware and Raritan Canal , which was built in 1834 and separates East Trenton and \\nTop Road; the canal and adjacent railroad tracks provided easy delivery of raw materials ( e.g., central New Jersey \\nclays and eastern Pennsylvania coals ) to the potteries and transport of finished goods from the potteries [Ref. 7, pp. \\n4–5; 11, p. 2; 43, pp. 1, 3–5, 7, 8 ; 51, p. 2 ]. Historical maps from 1 835, 1874, and 1882 provide evidence of the \\nindustrial pottery development in the East Trenton/Top Road area —the 1 835 map shows the area to be significantly \\nless developed, whereas the 1874 and 1882 maps show industrial potteries in clusters along the canal and adjacent \\nrailroad track s, and individual potteries at other locations in the East Trenton/Top Road area [Refs. 45, p.1; 46, pp. \\n1–4; 47, p. 1]. Historical maps from 1930 show additional potteries in the area, including in the easternmost portion \\nof the East Trenton/Top Road area [Ref. 48, pp. 2, 31 –38, 50 ]. Several of the former pottery locations in the East \\nTrenton/Top Road area are within the documented AOC, and most others within the East Trenton/Top Road area \\nare clustered near the documented AOC in areas that were not sampled by EPA [Ref. 46, pp. 1 -4; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. \\n2-11; see Figure 2 and Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation Record]. D evelopment of the East Trenton and \\nTop Road r esidential neighborhoods coincid ed with the industrial growth as a means to support the potteries and \\nother industries [Ref. 18, p. 5; 47, p, 1; 48, pp. 2, 31 –38, 50 ; 51, p. 2] . As the industry waned, some of the historical \\npottery locations in the East Trenton/Top Road area were converted to other uses including residential [Refs. 6, pp. \\n10, 13; 43, p. 2 ; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 2, 31 –38, 50 ]. \\nPotteries in Trenton manufactured tableware, sanitary ware, electrical porcelain , and art ceramics [Refs. 7, p. 12; 9, \\npp. 1, 3; 10, p. 2; 37, pp. 5 –8; 38, pp. 74 –76; 44, pp. 6 –42]. Lead was used in the ceramic glazes required for the \\nmanufacture of many of these products, which were subject to high temperatures in the firing kilns [Refs . 7, pp. 6 – \\n7, 13; 38, pp. 35 –42; 39, pp. 47 –52, 60 –65, 72; 40, pp. 35 –36, 45 –57; 41, pp. 2 –3]. The number of pottery kilns in \\nTrenton increased from 1 to 258 between 1852 an d 1903 [Ref. 38, p. 76]. Depictions of the Trenton kilns show \\nsmoke emanating from their stacks and moving with the wind; lead would have been released in these kiln emissions \\n22  \\n            \\n   \\n           \\n          \\n    \\n \\n \\n         \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n      \\n     \\n  \\n         \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n       \\n            \\n    \\n    \\n                \\n      \\n            \\n             \\n      \\n    \\n \\n     \\n         \\n      \\n         \\n   \\n \\n     \\n       \\n               \\n    \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n   \\n       \\n      \\n        \\n       and then settle into the soil downwind from the kilns (the prevailing wind direction in Trenton is northwesterly, and \\na large majority of wind direction is distributed across the western half from northerly to southerly) [Refs. 6, pp. 9, \\n11, 13; 7, p. 10; 37, p. 5; 33, p. 13; 39, pp. 182 –198; 41, p p. 2, 3; 42, pp. 2 –3; 43, p. 1 ; 56, p. 5 ]. Soil and debris \\ncontaining ceramic pieces that was used as fill material during development of the residential neighborhoods is also \\nadding to the lead contamination [Ref s. 6, p. 11; 11, p. 2 ; 53, pp. 2 –852; see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS \\ndocumentation record ]. \\nDuring multiple sampling events from October 2020 to July 2022, EPA sampled residential properties , public \\nproperties , and industrial properties within the study area for the Historic Potteries site [Refs. 12 , pp. 1, 12–28; 13, \\npp. 1, 13–19; 14, pp. 1, 13–21; 15, pp. 1, 13–16; 16, pp. 1, 13–17; 17, pp. 1, 14–16; 18, pp. 1, 6–9, 15 –27]. During \\nthese sampling events, EPA found pottery sherds (i.e., ceramic chips) within the contaminated soils on many \\nproperties to have lead field screening levels that were above EPA RMLs [Refs. 12, pp. 68–70, 76, 81 , 87–88, 99, \\n111, 115; 13, pp. 46, 55, 57, 58; 14, pp. 60, 69, 74; 15, pp. 51, 61, 62; 16, pp. 45, 50, 63; 17, pp. 48 –49, \\n56–57, 59, 66 –67; 18, pp. 5 –8, 11 –12, 53 –54, 63 –64, 68, 70 –71, 74, 90 –92, 101, 117, 129, 1 31; 33, pp. 2 –3, 8]. \\nEPA collected and analyzed some of the pottery sherds and reported lead levels up to 5,737 mg/kg [Ref. 18, pp. 6 – \\n8]. T he presence of lead concentrations elevated above RMLs at shallow depths is consistent with the presence of \\nceramic chips at similar depths and aerial deposition of kiln emissions from upwind historical pottery operations \\n[Ref. 33, p. 18 ]. EPA found lead to be one of the most leachable metals from the ceramic chips, indicating that \\nleaching of lead from the chips over ti me is one of the mechanisms of soil contamination [Ref. 33, pp. 10 –13, 18]. \\nIn 2023 and 2024, EPA performed additional sampling of residential properties , schools, and p arks in the Top Road \\nand East Trenton neighborhoods , as well as background locations outside the historic potteries area [Ref. 22, pp. 2 – \\n73; 53, pp. 1, 853 –956; 54, pp. 2 –6; 55, p p. 2–4, 7–8; see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record] . All \\nsamples were c ollected within the top 2 feet of soil , and residential/school property samples were collected within \\n200 feet of the residence or school/workplace [ Ref. 5 4, pp. 2 –3; see Section 5.1.0 and Figures 3a through 3i of \\nthis HRS documentation record ]. Results for the Grant Intermediate School, where there are 5 42 students and 45 \\nfull-time faculty members , show lead concentrations more than three times above background levels in several \\ngrass -and soil -covered areas on school grounds [see Tables 2, 3, 4, 7 , and 8 of this HRS documentation record ]. \\nThe lead levels for the surface soil samples collected throughout the school grounds exceed the recently updated \\nEPA Re moval Management Level (R ML) of 200 mg/kg [Refs. 6, pp. 14 –15; 36, pp. 1 –2]. Therefore, EPA i s \\nperforming interim actions to protect the school community from the lead contamination in the soil , including \\ntemporary restriction to contaminated areas until protective measures are installed (i.e., clean cover material in the \\nmain play areas and temporary fencing around low use areas) [Refs. 6, pp. 17 –18]. \\nIn addition to the lead contamination at the school, analytical results show that lead contamination more than three \\ntimes above the site -specific background level affects 84 occupied residential properties and four vacant residential \\nor community properties [see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record] . EPA encountered evidence of \\npottery waste fill (i.e., ceramic debris) at 84 of the 8 9 properties within the documented AOC, including the school \\n[see Tables 3 and 4 of this HRS documentation record]. \\nFor the Historic Potteries site, EPA is evaluating the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway —soil exposure \\ncomponent . The results of the 2023 -2024 sampling investigation document the presence of a hazardous substance \\n(lead) at levels that meet the criteria for observed contamination in soil at a school and at 84 occupied residential \\nproperties; the observed contamination on each property is within 200 feet of each respective structure . The data \\ndocument Level II concentrations affecting a resident population of 768.96 (i.e., 5 42 students and 226.96 resident s). \\nThe AOC also affects at least 45 full-time workers (i.e., the school faculty) . Older data not used in the HRS scoring \\nevaluation indicates that the AO C probably extend s to numerous other occupied residential , public, and commercial \\nproperties within the AOC ; that there is spatial correlation of former pottery location s and the lead contamination ; \\nand that the isotopic composition of soil lead can be correlated to the isotopic composition of co -located ceramic \\nchips in many cases [Refs. 12, pp. 12 –73; 13, pp. 13 –47; 14, pp. 13 –61; 15, pp. 13 –52; 16, pp. 13 –45; 17, pp. 14 – \\n50; 18, pp. 6 –9, 15 –55; 33, pp. 1–3, 8, 10 –13, 18–19]. The site as scored for HRS purposes and presented in this \\nHRS documentation record includes one AOC with documented Level II concentrations of a hazardous substance \\n23  \\n          \\n \\n  (lead) ; this contamination originat ed from the numerous historic potteries that operated in the area . As is shown in \\nthis HRS documentation record, the site qualifies for listing on the NPL based on the HRS score. \\n24  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n             \\n \\n \\n  2.2.1  SOURCE IDENTIFICATION \\nNumber of Source : 1 \\nName of Source : Area of Contamination (AOC) A \\nSource Type : Contaminated Soil \\nDescription and Location of the Source : \\nThe soil contamination is characterized in Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record as an area of p ropertie s \\ncontaining observed contamination (collectively scored as AOC A) [see Figures 1 and 3 of this HRS documentation \\nrecord ]. \\n25  \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n              \\n          \\n       \\n             \\n                    \\n                \\n    \\n                   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n          \\n \\n        \\n      \\n         \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n           \\n       \\n         \\n           \\n       \\n \\n         \\n         \\n   \\n        \\n      \\n      \\n         \\n                \\n       \\n   5.0 SOIL EXPOSURE AND SUBSURFACE INTRUSION PATHWAY \\n5.0.1 EXPOSURE COMPONENTS \\nComponent(s) being scored: \\nThe s oil exposure component is scored based on the resident population threat as detailed in the following sections \\nof this HRS documentation record [Ref. 1, Section s 5.1 and 5.1.0]. \\n5.1 SOIL EXPOSURE COMPONENT \\n5.1.0 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS \\nAccording to the HRS, the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway is based \\non observed contamination and AOC s [Ref. 1, Section 5.1.0 ]. All soil samp les meeting the criteria for observed \\ncontamination at the Historic Potteries site were collected at depth intervals within the top 2 feet below ground \\nsurface ( bgs), as documented in Table 3 of this HRS documentation record .

Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record shows the location of each property \\nmeeting the criteria for observed contamination, outlines the estimated AOC, and shows the level of contamination \\n(i.e., Level II ) for each property ; Figure s 3a through 3i of this HRS documentation record provide additional detail . \\nOnly those properties with sampling results indicating lead levels equal to or greater than three times background \\nlevels are included in the HRS score [see Tables 2, 3, and 4 of this HRS documentation record] . \\nAs further detailed in Sample Collection and Processing Procedures for All Soil Samples below, three -to five -\\npoint composite samples were used to document observed contamination. The AOC was delineated by creating a \\npolygon connecting the outermost observed contamination samples, drawing the line through the innermost aliquot \\nfrom each comp osite sample [see Figures 3 and 3a through 3i of this HRS documentation record] . Contamination \\nis not inferred between locations of observed contamination because there are s ignificant spatial gaps between some \\nof the points of observed contamination based on the number and location of observed contamination samples [see \\nFigure s 3 and 3a through 3 i]. In addition, a significant contributor to the contamination w as the nonuniform use \\nof pottery waste as fill material , which resulted in nonuniform distribution of contaminants [Ref. 6, pp. 8–13; 53, \\npp. 2 –852]. Redevelopment activities at properties in East Trenton since the releases ended , such as soil \\nremediation, construction and reconstruction activities, and installation of community gardens and urban farms, \\n26  \\n   \\n            \\n      \\n          \\n \\n \\n          \\n          \\n            \\n                \\n       \\n        \\n        \\n    \\n          \\n       \\n        \\n  \\n         \\n            \\n \\n \\n          \\n   \\n           \\n               \\n           \\n         \\n     \\n           \\n       \\n   \\n \\n      \\n              \\n         \\n      \\n         \\n     \\n          \\n       \\n         \\n               \\n     \\n         \\n           \\n     \\n \\n          \\n       \\n      \\n         \\n      \\n          could also have led to discontinuities in contaminant patterns in the intervening areas [ Refs. 49, pp. 67, 71 –72, 81; \\n50, pp. 2, 5]. There are several properties in the East Trenton/Top Road area that are being addressed by the state \\nor federal brownfields programs, which may include brownfields grant funding [Ref. 50, pp. 3 –5]. Properties being \\naddressed under the state and federal brownfields programs are also not considered for scoring in this proposed \\nlisting. \\nExclusion of properties from scoring does not indicate an absence of contamination —properties excluded from \\nscoring include properties with soil lead concentrations equal to or greater than the RML of 200 mg/kg but below \\nthree times background levels, and properties that have not yet been sampled [Ref. 36, pp. 1 –2; 53, pp. 854, 856, \\n887, 888, 902, 942; see Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3 of this HRS documentation record ]. Soil removals have not \\nbeen performed and are not scheduled for the properties scored as subject to observed contamination within the \\nAOC [Ref. 51, p p. 3–4]. EPA is installing temporary , protective cover materials at the Grant Intermediate School \\nas an emergency measure [Ref. 51, p. 3]. This interim action does not include removal of contaminated soil from \\nthe property, and the cover materials are permeable and less than 2 feet thick (i.e., topsoil, sod, and mulch) and do \\nnot represent a permanent cleanup solution [Ref. 51, p p. 3–4]. Surface soil samples that meet the observed \\ncontamination criteria were used to delineate the AOC [Ref. 1, Table 2 -3 and Section 5.1.0 ] [see Figure 3 and \\nTable 4 of this HRS documentation record ]. The background soil samples and the so il samples documenting \\nobserved contamination were collected during EPA investigation of the site from September 2023 to January 2024 \\n[Ref. 22, pp. 2, 4–73]. EPA is investigating f urther delineation of lead contamination at the site, including interim \\nprotective actions at the school and additional residential sampling in East Trenton as requested [Ref. 6, pp. 16– \\n18]. \\nSample Collection and Processing Procedures for All Soil Samples : EPA collected a ll soil samples in accordance \\nwith EPA -approved Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPP) dated August 2023 and November 2023; the QAPPs \\nreference standard operating procedures to be followed for sample collection, processing, analysis, and validation \\nas approved by EPA Region 2 Quality Assurance Officer delegates [Refs. 19, pp. 8, 15, 36–38, 40, 59 ; 20, pp. 8, \\n16, 38–40, 42, 61 ; 53, p. 1 ]. To avoid any possible contamination coming from historical use of lead -based paint on \\nhouses, drip zones were avoided and not included in any of the composite soil samples that document observed \\ncontamination (EPA collected drip -zone composite samples separately at some properties) [Refs. 19, pp. 172 –174; \\n20, p p. 174 –176; 53, pp. 1, 853 –954]. All soil samples w ere collected as three -to five-point composite s in \\naccordance with the EPA Superfund Lead -Contaminated Residential Sites Handbook (August 2003) [ Refs. 19, pp. \\n15, 44, 144; 20, pp. 16, 46, 146; 53, p. 1 ; 54, pp. 2 –3]. \\nEPA collected the composite soil samples from soil borings using decontaminated, non -dedicated, stainless -steel \\nhand augers ; all s oil boring locations for composite sampling at occupied properties were within 200 feet of the \\nresidence or school/workplace [Refs. 19, p. 15; 20, p. 16 ; 53, pp. 1, 853–954; 54]. Each three -to five-point \\ncomposite sample consist ed of aliquots collected from the same depth interval at the five boring locations —samples \\nwere collected as such from depth intervals of 0 to 2 inches , 2 to 6 inches , 6 to 12 inches , 12 to 18 inches , and 18 \\nto 24 inches below ground surface (bgs) (i.e., five total samples w ere collected from each area sampled ) [Refs. 19, \\npp. 15, 44; 20, pp. 16, 46; 26, pp. 3 –4; 27, pp. 4 –5, 7; 28, pp. 4 –8; 29, pp. 5 –16; 30, pp. 4 –15; 31, pp. 4 –15; 54; see \\nTables 1 and 3 of this HRS documentation record ]. All the composite soil samples w ere dried , then sieved using a \\n150-micrometer (μm) sieve , at the EPA Laboratory S ervices and Applied Sciences Division (LSASD) facility i n\\nEdison, NJ, prior to being submitted to the laboratory for analysis [Refs. 19, p. 15; 20, p. 16 ; 53, p. 1 ; 54]. The\\nstainless -steel hand augers and the sieves were decontaminated between samples, and r insate blank s were collecte d\\nregular ly throughout the sampling event to demonstrate adequate decontamination of this nondedicated samplin g\\nequipment [Refs. 19, pp. 15, 44; 20, pp. 16, 46; 26, pp. 3 –4; 27, pp. 4 –5, 7; 28, pp. 4 –8; 29, pp. 5 –16; 30, pp. 4 –15;\\n31, pp. 4 –15; 53, p. 1 ; 54]. Chain -of-custody records for the soil samples are provided in Reference s 22 and 5 5.\\nLaboratory Analytical Method , Data Verification/V alidation , and Reporting Limits for All Soil Samples : All \\nsoil samples show ing background levels or observed contamination were analyzed at the EPA Region 2 Laboratory \\nin Edison, NJ , for metals, including lead, using EPA Method 200. 7 [Refs. 21, p. 3; 26, pp. 3 –4; 27, pp. 4 –5, 7; 28, \\npp. 4 –8; 29, pp. 5 –16; 30, pp. 4 –15; 31, pp. 4 –15]. These analytical results are used to identify soil samples that \\ndocument background levels and meet the observed contamination criteria [Ref. 1, Table 2 -3; see Section 5.1.0 of \\nthis HRS documentation record ].

The reporting limits (RL) were reported in accordance \\nwith method requirements; they are limits of quantitation that represent the lowest concentration at which an analyte \\ncan be detected in a sample and its concentration can be reported with a reasonable degree of accuracy and precision , \\nand they are matrix -and dilution -dependent [Refs. 21, pp. 4, 6, 32, 40, 46 ; 52, p . 12]. This is equivalent to the HRS \\ndefinition of sample quantitation limit ( SQL ) (i.e., the quantity of a hazardous substance that can be reasonably \\nquantified give n the limits of detection for the method of analysis and sample characteristics that may affect \\nquantitation (e.g., dilution, concentration) [Ref. 1, Section 1.1]. \\nBackground Samples – Locations and Descriptions \\nAs part of the EPA sa mpling efforts, EPA collected background soil samples from two properties to establish \\nbackground levels for lead. In September 2023, EPA collected five -point composite soil samples from a public \\nproperty along the Route 1 corridor, approximately 2 miles northeast of the documented extent of historic pottery \\nlocations and approximately 2.4 miles northeast of the AOC (EPA assigned ID number HP000 -P001 to this \\nproperty); in December 2023, EPA collected five -point composite soil samples from a public park located \\napproximately 0.6 mile west -northwest of the documented extent of historic pottery locations, and about 2 miles \\nwest-northwest of the AOC (EPA had previously collected discrete samples from this property and assigned it ID \\nnumber HP003 -P001) [Refs. 7, p. 2; 12, p. 28; 22, pp. 4, 51 –52; see Figure 1 of this HRS documentation record] . \\nThe samples were collected from these site-specific background reference area s to evaluate anthropogenic ambient \\nsoil background conditions (i.e., hazardous substance levels that r eflect widespread impacts of nonpoint sources, \\nsuch as historical leaded gasoline emissions) outside the impact area of the site [Ref. 24, pp. 23 -24, 33 –34, 245] . \\nLocation HP000 -P001 is vegetated land between developed properties along a 4 -lane roadway, and location HP003 -\\nP001 is a park surrounded by city streets [ see Figure s 1a and 1b of this HRS documentation record]. Both locations \\nare beyond the full known extent of former pottery locations, and neither is located directly downwind of the former \\npottery locations based on the prevailing northwesterly wind direction [Ref. 6, p. 13; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 2, 39 –49; 56, \\np.5; see Figure s 1, 1a, and 1b of this HRS documentation record]. EPA did not encounter pottery waste fil l\\nmaterials (i.e., ceramic debris) in the soils at either location during the 2023 sampling activities [Ref. 53, pp. 2 –16,\\n843–852, 853, 951] .\\nThe background soil samples are considered comparable to the observed contamination soil samples , as follows: \\n•The background soil and observed contamination soil samples were collected from urban soils under t he\\nsame type of environmental influences, such as traffic, roads, and anthropogenic activities [Ref. 53, pp.\\n854–953].\\n•The background soil and observed contamination soil samples were collected and processed accord ing to\\nthe same sample collection and sieving techniques [Ref. 53, p. 1 ; 54, pp. 2 –6].\\n•The background soil and observed contamination soil samples were collected from specific depth interval s\\nspanning the top 2 feet of the soil column within the same relative timeframe [see Tables 1 and 3 of thi s\\nHRS documentation record] .\\n•The background soil and observed contamination soil samples were predominantly mixtures of clay, silt ,\\nsand, and/or gravel, with the predominant soil types in the background soil samples (clayey silt, silty clay ,\\nand sandy silt) being finer -grained than the predominant soil types in the observed contamination soi l\\nsamples (sandy silt and silty sand) [see Tables 1 and 3 of this HRS documentation record] .\\n•The background soil and observed contamination soil samples were analyzed via the same analytica l\\nmethod [see above, Laboratory Analytical Method , Data Verification/V alidation , and Reportin g\\nLimits for All Soil Samples ].\\nBackground soil sample identifications, locations, sample type , depths, and sampling dates are shown in Table 1 \\nof this HRS documentation record, and laboratory analytical results are presented in Table 2 of this HRS \\ndocumentation record. The samples ending in “ -02” are field duplicates of the samples ending in “ -01” [Refs. 19, \\np.44; 20, p. 46] .

This is equivalent to the HRS definition of SQL (i.e., the\\nquantity of a hazardous substance that can be reasonably quantified given the limits of detection for the method of analysis and sample\\ncharacteristics that may affect quantitation (e.g., dilutio n, concentration) [Ref. 1, Section 1.1] .\\n30  \\n                    \\n             \\n                   \\n             \\n               \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n       \\n              \\n     \\n     \\n                \\n          \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     \\n      \\n        \\n               \\n             \\n          \\n      \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n     \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n       \\n    \\n     \\n \\n  \\n        \\n  \\n \\n       \\n    \\n            \\n     \\n  \\n       \\n   \\n              \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n           \\n     \\n  (2) BOLD indicates background concentration chosen for use as the background level for each hazardous substance. L ead at 126 mg/kg in\\nsample 2308018 -03 is used as the background level because it is the highest lead concentration among the background samples.\\n(3) J = The identification of the analyte is acceptable; the reported value is an estimate with unknown bias [Ref. 31, pp. 2, 33]. For high or\\nunknown biased qualified background sample results, t he value presented parenthetically is the estimated maximum concentration obtained\\nby applying adjustment factors from the EPA fact sheet Using Qualified Data to Document and Observed Release and Observed\\nContamination (November 2022) [Ref. 32, pp. 8, 20].\\nAdditional Supporting Information for Background Levels \\nAs shown above, t he range of lead concentration s among the soil samples collected at the background reference \\nareas is 6.42 mg/kg to 126 mg/kg . This range of lead concentrations in the samples is considered indicative of \\nanthropogenic background, as a previous evaluation of available background data by EPA indicated a 5th percentile \\nconcentration of approximately 6 mg/kg, a 95th percentile concentration of approximately 37 mg/kg, and a \\nmaximum concentration of approximately 11 3 mg/kg for lead in eastern U.S. soils [Ref. 25, pp. 63, 66] . The same \\nstudy by EPA reported a mean background concentration of 35 mg/kg for lead in the New Jersey soils subset [Ref. \\n25, p. 39] . \\nContaminated Samples -Observed Contamination Locations, AOC A, Residential Soils \\nObserved contamination soil sample IDs, locations, sample type , depths, and sampling dates are shown in Table 3 \\nof this HRS documentation record, and laboratory analytical results that meet observed contamination criteria are \\npresented in Table 4 of this HRS documentation record. The samples ending in “-02” are field duplicates of the \\nsamples ending in “-01” [Refs. 19, p. 44; 20, p. 46]. Observed contamination soil sampling locations are three -to \\nfive-point composite samples from specific depth intervals spanning the top 2 feet of the soil column ; they were \\ncollected from the property locations shown in Figure 3 and Figures 3a through 3i of this HRS documentation \\nrecord . As shown previously, the observed contamination soil samples were collected , processed, and analyzed \\naccord ing to the same methods as the background samples and within the same relative timeframe [ see above, \\nSample Collection and Processing Procedures for All Soil Samples and Laboratory Analytical Method , Data \\nVerification/V alidation , and Reporting Limits for All Soil Samples ].

Due to the history of the East Trenton/Top \\nRoad area, where numerous industrial-scale potteries formerly operated, EPA is investigating the pottery industry \\nas the source of elevated lead levels in the area [Refs. 6, pp. 8–11; 7, pp. 2–5; 11, p. 1; 12, p. 5]. EPA identified \\nmore than 30 locations in and around the East Trenton/Top Road area where one or more pottery manufacturing \\nbusinesses formerly operated [Refs. 6, pp. 8–10]. These industrial-scale potteries operated in the area over \\nvariable timeframes between the 1850s and the mid-20th century [Refs. 6, p. 10; 7, pp. 2–5; 8, p. 2; 9, pp. 1, 3; 37, \\np. 5; 44, pp. 1, 6–39]. In 1850, just one industrial pottery was operating in Trenton [Ref. 7, p. 4; 8, p. 2; 44, p. 37]. \\nHowever, the industry grew increasingly prominent in the city from the 1850s until the 1920s (in 1924, more \\nthan 50 facilities were operating simultaneously in Trenton) , when it began to shrink considerably during the \\nGreat Depression [Refs. 7, pp. 4–5; 8, p. 2; 9, p. 1;  10, p. 3; 38, pp. 74–76; 44, pp. 6–42]. \\nThe reasons for the growth of the pottery industry in Trenton from the 1850s until the 1920s were the city’s \\ncentral location with respect to markets (New York and Philadelphia) and its role as a hub in the regional \\ntransportation network of canals and railroads [Refs. 6, p. 8; 7, p. 4; 43, p. 1, 3]. The surge of industrial \\npottery development occurred primarily along the Delaware and Raritan Canal, which was built in 1834 and \\nseparates East Trenton and Top Road; the canal and adjacent railroad tracks provided easy delivery of raw \\nmaterials (e.g., central New Jersey clays and eastern Pennsylvania coals) to the potteries and transport of finished \\ngoods from the potteries [Ref. 7, pp. 4–5; 11, p. 2; 43, pp. 1, 3–5, 7, 8; 51, p. 2]. Historical maps from 1835, 1874, \\nand 1882 provide evidence of the industrial pottery development in the East Trenton/Top Road area —the 1835 \\nmap shows the area to be significantly less developed, whereas the 1874 and 1882 maps show industrial potteries \\nin clusters along the canal and adjacent railroad tracks, and individual potteries at other locations in the East \\nTrenton/Top Road area [Refs. 45, p.1; 46, pp. 1–4; 47, p. 1]. Historical maps from 1930 show additional potteries \\nin the area, including in the easternmost portion of the East Trenton/Top Road area [Ref. 48, pp. 2, 31–38, 50]. \\nSeveral of the former pottery locations in the East Trenton/Top Road area are within the documented AOC, and \\nmost others within the East Trenton/Top Road area are clustered near the documented AOC in areas that were not \\nsampled by EPA [Ref. 46, pp. 1-4; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 2-11; see Figure 2 and Section 5.1.0 of this HRS \\ndocumentation Record]. Development of the East Trenton and Top Road residential neighborhoods coincided with \\nthe industrial growth as a means to support the potteries and other industries [Ref. 18, p. 5; 47, p, 1; 48, pp. 2, 31–\\n38, 50; 51, p. 2]. As the industry waned, some of the historical  pottery locations in the East Trenton/Top Road \\narea were converted to other uses including residential [Refs. 6, pp.  10, 13; 43, p. 2; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 2, 31–38, 50].\\nPotteries in Trenton manufactured tableware, sanitary ware, electrical porcelain, and art ceramics [Refs. 7, p. 12; \\n9, pp. 1, 3; 10, p. 2; 37, pp. 5–8; 38, pp. 74–76; 44, pp. 6–42]. Lead was used in the ceramic glazes required for \\nthe manufacture of many of these products, which were subject to high temperatures in the firing kilns [Refs. 7, \\npp. 6– 7, 13; 38, pp. 35–42; 39, pp. 47–52, 60–65, 72; 40, pp. 35 –36, 45–57; 41, pp. 2–3]. The number of pottery \\nkilns in Trenton increased from 1 to 258 between 1852 and 1903 [Ref. 38, p. 76]. Depictions of the Trenton \\nkilns show smoke emanating from their stacks and moving with the wind; lead would have been released in these \\nkiln emissions and then settle into the soil downwind from the kilns [Refs. 6, pp. 9, 11; 7, p. 10; 37, p. 5; 33, p. 13; \\n39, pp. 182– 198; 41, pp. 2, 3; 42, pp. 2–3; 43, p. 1]. Soil and debris containing ceramic pieces that was used as \\nfill material during development of the residential neighborhoods is also adding to the lead contamination [Refs. \\n6, p. 11; 11, p. 2; 53, pp. 2–852; s ee Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record] . \\nDuring multiple sampling events from October 2020 to July 2022, EPA sampled residential properties, public \\nproperties, and industrial properties within the study area for the Historic Potteries site [Refs. 12, pp. 1, 12–28; 13, \\npp. 1, 13–19; 14, pp. 1, 13–21; 15, pp. 1, 13–16; 16, pp. 1, 13–17; 17, pp. 1, 14–16; 18, pp. 1, 6–9, 15–27]. During \\nthese sampling events, EPA found pottery sherds (i.e., ceramic chips) within the contaminated soils on many \\n67  \\n      \\n      \\n     \\n  \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n        \\n         \\n         \\n \\n \\n     \\n            \\n       \\n       \\n               \\n     \\n        \\n            \\n     \\n         \\n       \\n    \\n           \\n       \\n         \\n            \\n    \\n \\n      \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n     \\n          \\n          \\n  \\n          \\n       \\n     \\n          \\n           \\n    \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n        \\n      \\n         \\n      properties to have lead field screening levels that were above EPA RMLs [Refs. 12, pp. 68–70, 76, 81 , 87–88, 99, \\n111, 115; 13, pp. 46, 55, 57, 58; 14, pp. 60, 69, 74; 15, pp. 51, 61, 62; 16, pp. 45, 50, 63; 17, pp. 48 –49, \\n56–57, 59, 66 –67; 18, pp. 5 –8, 11 –12, 53 –54, 63 –64, 68, 70 –71, 74, 90 –92, 101, 117, 129, 131; 33, pp. 2 –3, 8]. \\nEPA collected and analyzed some of the pottery sherds and reported lead levels up to 5,737 mg/kg [Ref. 18, pp. 6 – \\n8]. EPA found that there is spatial correlation of former pottery locations and lead contamination within the AOC \\nand that t he presence of lead concentrations elevated above RMLs at shallow depths is consistent with the presence \\nof ceramic chips at similar depths and aerial deposition of kiln emissions from upwind historical pottery operations \\n[Ref. 33, p. 18 –19]. EPA found lead to be one of the most leachable metals from the ceramic chips and that the \\nisotopic composition of soil lead can be correlated to the isotopic composition of co -located ceramic chips in many \\ncases , indicating that leaching of lead from the chips over time is one of the mechanisms of soil contamination [Ref. \\n33, pp. 10 –13, 18 –19]. \\nEPA performed additional sampling of residential properties , schools, and p arks in the Top Road and East Trenton \\nneighborhoods , as well as background locations outside the historic potteries area, from in 2023 and 2024 [Ref. 22, \\npp. 2 –73; 53, pp. 1, 853 –956; 55, pp. 2 –4, 7–8; see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record] . All samples \\nwere c ollected within the top 2 feet of soil , and residential/school property samples were collected within 200 feet \\nof the residence or school/workplace [ Ref. 54, pp. 2 -3; see Section 5.1.0 and Figures 3a through 3i of this HRS \\ndocumentation record ]. Results for the Grant Intermediate School, where there are 542 students and 45 full -time \\nfaculty members , show lead concentrations more than three times above background levels in several grass -and \\nsoil-covered areas on school grounds [see Tables 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 of this HRS documentation record ]. The lead \\nlevels for the surface soil samples collected throughout the school grounds exceed the recently updated EPA \\nRemoval Management Level (R ML) of 200 mg/kg [Refs. 6, pp. 14 –15; 36, pp. 1 –2]. Therefore, EPA is performing \\ninterim actions to protect the school community from the lead contamination in the soil , including temporary \\nrestriction to contaminated areas until protective measures are installed (i.e., clean cover material in the main play \\nareas and temporary fencing around low use areas) [Refs. 6, pp. 17 –18]. In addition to the lead contamination at the \\nschool, analytical results show that lead contamination more than three times above the site -specific background \\nlevel affects 84 occupied residential properties [see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record] . EPA \\nencountered evidence of pottery waste fill (i.e., ceramic debris) at 80 of the 85 properties within the documented \\nAOC, including the school [see Tables 3 and 4 of this HRS documentation record]. \\nAs part of its 2023 -2024 sa mpling efforts, EPA collected 16 five -point composite background soil samples from a \\npublic property along the Route 1 corridor, approximately 2 miles northeast of the documented extent of historic \\npottery locations (EPA assigned ID number HP000 -P001 to this property) , and 11 five -point composite soil samples \\nfrom a public park located approximately 2 miles west -northwest (EPA had previously collected discrete samples \\nfrom this property and assigned it ID number HP003 -P001) [Refs. 7, p. 2; 12, p. 28; 22, pp. 4, 51 –52; see Figure 1 \\nand Table 2 of this HRS documentation record] . The samples were collected from these site-specific background \\nreference area s to evaluate anthropogenic ambient soil background conditions (i.e., hazardous substance levels that \\nreflect widespread impacts of nonpoint sources, such as historical leaded gasoline emissions) outside the impact \\narea of the site [Ref. 24, pp. 23 -24, 33 –34, 245] . Location HP000 -P001 is vegetated land between developed \\nproperties along a 4 -lane roadway, and location HP003 -P001 is a park surrounded by city s treets [ Ref. 53, pp. 853, \\n951; see Figure s 1a and 1b of this HRS documentation record]. Both locations are beyond the full known extent \\nof former pottery locations, and neither is located directly downwind of the former pottery locations based on the \\nprevailing northwesterly wind direction [Ref. 6, p. 13; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 2, 39 –49; 56, p. 5 ; see Figure s 1, 1a, and \\n1b of this HRS documentation record]. EPA did not encounter pottery waste fill materials (i.e., ceramic debris) in \\nthe soils at either backgroun d location during the 2023 sampling activities [Ref. 53, pp. 2 –16, 843 –852, 853, 951]. \\nThe highest concentrations of lead reported for the background soil samples were 19.3 mg/kg (laboratory sample \\nID: 2308018 -06) and 126 mg/kg (laboratory sample ID: 2308018 -03), respectively, as shown in Table 2 of this \\nHRS documentation record. The observed contamination soil samples are considered comparable to the background \\nsoil samples [see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record ]. EPA encountered evidence of pottery waste fill \\n(i.e., ceramic debris) at 80 of the 85 properties within the document ed AOC, including the school [see Tables 3 \\nand 4 of this HRS documentation record]. The AOC soil samples showed lead levels equal to or greater than three \\ntimes the site -specific background level, as shown in Table 4 of this HRS documentation record ; this significant \\nincrease in concentrations over anthropogenic ambient soil background conditions is considered at least partially \\n68  \\n      \\n \\n \\n          \\n      \\n          \\n               \\n   \\n     \\n          \\n      \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  attributable to the historic potteries that operated in the East Trenton/Top Road area [Ref s. 6, p. 11; 33, pp. 1 –2, \\n10–13, 18]. \\nOther possible contributors to the lead contamination in the area include the historical leaded gasoline emissions, \\nwaste incineration, lead -based paints, aerosols, and emissions fill materials from other industrial operations \\nincluding coal combustion, pe troleum refining, and a former solder manufacturer [Refs. 6, pp. 6 –7; 33, pp. 2, 18]. \\nIn addition, the historical maps form the late 19th and early 20th centuries show the emergence of other industries in \\nthe area , including coal, rubber, iron, and steel, which could have contributed to lead contamination [Ref. 4 6, pp. 1, \\n2, 4; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 8, 31 –38, 50]. EPA has determined that these non -CERCLA sources are not the main sources \\nof lead in the area, and that the p ottery fill and airborne releases from the pottery kilns contributed significantly to \\nthe lead contamination [Ref. 6, p. 11]. There are several City -owned properties that are being addressed by the state \\nor federal brownfields programs, which may include brownfields grant funding [Ref. 50, pp. 3 –5]. Properties being \\naddressed under the state and federal brownfields programs are not included in this proposed listing. In addition, no \\nindividuals are documented to be living on those properties. \\nHazardous Substance s in the Release \\nLead \\n69  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n      \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n       \\n         \\n          \\n            \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n      \\n       \\n  \\n         \\n        \\n            \\n            \\n         \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n            \\n       \\n     \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n             \\n          \\n   \\n           \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  Area of Contamination Hazardous Waste Quantity \\n2.4.2.1.1 Hazardous Constituent Quantity \\nThe total hazardous constituent quantity for AOC A could not be adequately determined according to the HRS \\nrequirements; that is, the total mass of all Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability \\nAct (CERCLA) hazardous substances in A OC A is not known and cannot be estimated with reasonable confidence \\n[Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.1 ].

EPA identified ceramic debris and lead contamination on public \\nproperties , including parks that are accessible to the public during the 2023 -2024 sampling activities at the Historic \\nPotteries site [Refs. 22, pp. 66–73; lab package; 31, pp. 11 –14, 210 –299; 53, pp. 512–525, 691 –756, 954–956]. \\nEPA is continuing its investigation of the site , which may include sampling of additional residential and public \\nproperties in the Historic Potteries site area. \\n83 OLEM/OSRTI\\nWashington, DC 20460\\nNATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST (NPL) \\n***Proposed  NPL Site***  September  2024 \\nCARLISLE VILLAGE CLEANERS  Albuquerque , New Mexico  \\nBernalillo County  \\n\\uf0feSite Location :\\nCarlisle Village Cleaners site is located at 3611 Simms Avenue SE in Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico. \\nThe site consists of a soil gas plume centered  within the South Carlisle Shopping Village strip mall and extending into  \\na mixed commercial and residential area located east of downtown Albuquerque.  \\n\\uf0a1 Site History:  \\nThe site consists of a chlorinated  solvent soil  gas plume that is centered at two former dry cleaner facilities that were \\nlocated within a small strip mall. Together, the former dry cleaners operated from 19 53 to 2017.    \\n\\uf090 Site Contamination/Contaminants:  \\nThe soil gas plume consists of  tetrachloroethylene (also known as perchloroethylene [PCE]) and  trichloroethylene \\n(TCE). Indoor air concentrations of PCE have been detected in both commercial and residential structures.  \\n\\uf094 Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment : \\nThere are 21 occupied single -family residential structures, 80 occupied multi -family residential ground -floor subunits, \\n16 occupied commercial structures, and two occupied religious institutions  in the vicinity of  the former dry cleaners  that \\nhave been identified as affected or potentially affected by the contamination to date . There is an estimated population of  \\n257 individuals that may be impacted by the contamination . \\n\\uf050 Response Activities (to date):  \\nEPA installed temporary air purifying units to the strip mall occupants in November 2022 and continues to change out \\nthe filters in these units as needed.  \\n\\uf09b Need for NPL Listing: \\nThe state of New Mexico referred the site to the EPA because it is the most appropriate entity  to investigate the\\nextent of contamination and determine how to address the site. Other federal and state cleanup programs were \\nevaluated but are not viable at this time because of the complexity of the site. The EPA received a letter of support for  \\nplacing this site on the NPL from the state of New Mexico.    \\n[The description of the site (release) is based on information available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS. The description may \\nchange as additional information is gathered on the sources and extent of contamination. See 56 FR 5600, February 11, 1991, or subsequent \\nFR notices.] \\nFor more information about the hazardous substances identified in this narrative summary, including general information regarding the effects of exposure to \\nthese substances on human health, please see the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) ToxFAQs.

They represent one or more locations EPA considers to be part of the site based \\non the screening informati on EPA used to evaluate the site for NPL listing. EPA lists national priorities among the \\nknown \"releases or threatened releases\" of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely \\ndelineated boundaries. A site is defined as where a hazardous substance has been \"deposited, stored, disposed, or \\nplaced, or has otherwise come to be located.\" Generally, HRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release \\nmerely represent the initial determination that a certain area may need to be address ed under CERCLA. \\nAccordingly, EPA contemplates that the preliminary description of facility boundaries at the time of scoring will \\nbe refined as more information is developed as to where the contamination has come to be located. \\nScores \\nAir Pathway Not Scored \\nGround Water1 Pathway Not Scored \\nSoil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion Pathway 100 \\nSurface Water Pathway Not Scored \\nHRS SITE SCORE 50.00 \\n1 “Ground water” and “groundwater” are synonymous; the spelling is different due to “ground water” being codified as part \\nof the HRS, while “groundwater” is the modern spelling. \\nCarlisle Village Cleaners \\nNMN000622185 1  \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n   \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n       \\n  \\n  WORKSHEET FOR COMPUTING HRS SITE SCORE \\nS S2 \\n1.

The area of observed exposure (AOE) covers an \\nestimated area of 18 acres of a predominately residential neighborhood with som e light commercial activity (Ref. \\n59). The AOE include s 16 single -family residential structures, 70 multi -family residential subunits, 16 \\ncommercial subunits, and two religious institutions ; for HRS scoring purposes this involves approximately 190 \\nresidents and 85 workers. There are three unoccupied commercial structures ( given ROS numbers 398, 711, and \\n802 for tracking purposes ) and five multi -family residential subunits located above the ground floor (subunits of \\nROS 118, 202, and 808 ) which were not included in HRS calculations (for HRS purposes, only regularly \\noccupied structures are eligible for scoring; in multi -story, multi -subunit, regularly occupied structures, only \\nsubunits on a level with observed exposure samples and levels below are considered to be within an AOE; also, \\nfor multi -subunit structures inferred to be in an AOE, only regularly occupied subunits on the lowest level of the \\nstructure are counted as part of the AOE. [Ref. 1, Section 5.2.0]). Additionally, although subsurface soil vapor \\ncontamination is discussed in this HRS documentation record, an area of subsurface contamination is not scored \\nfor HRS purposes. (See Table 1 and Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record.) \\nAs shown by Site investigation history below and discussed in the Attribution section of this HRS documentation \\nrecord, t he origin of contamination at the Site is a release, or releases, from past operations at Carlisle Village \\nCleaners and L&M Laundry and Cleaners located at 3611 and 3607 Simms Avenue SE in Albuquerque, \\nBernalillo County, New Mexico (Figure 1 of this HRS documentation record , Ref. 3, p. 1 ). An area of \\ncontaminated soil vapor was discovere d during the field investigation portion of an Abbreviated Preliminary \\nAssessment performed by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) in May 2022. Further \\ninvestigations at the Site identified contaminated soil vapor originating at the facilit ies (Ref. 33, pp. 19 -21; Ref. \\n35, pp. 6 -7, 10 -11; Ref. 39, pp. 15, 20-21). The contamination extends for approximately 600 feet radially from \\nthe facilit ies (Ref. 39, p. 21; Ref. 46, pp. 3-4; Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record ). The total mass of \\ncontaminated soil vapor is not known. \\nThe contaminants of concern (COCs) at the Site and found within soil vapor contamination are PCE and its \\ndaughter product, trichloroethene (TCE) (Ref. 35, pp. 8 -9, 11 ). Historic al dry-cleaning operations are often the \\nsource of environmental releases of chlorinated solvents due to the absence of pollution prevention controls on \\nhistoric al dry-cleaning machines or improper storage and waste disposal practices at historic al facilities (Ref. 26, \\np. 2; Ref. 27, pp. 8, 20 -21). PCE is scored for HRS purposes in t his HRS documentation record; TCE is not scored \\nbecause it is not expected to significantly contribute to the site score. \\nDuring the November/December 2023 subsurface characterization field event (NMED), Site geology to 105 feet \\nbelow ground surface was characterized during the drilling and installation of two soil vapor monitor wells \\n(SVMW -01 and SVMW -02). Within the first 105 feet, five hydrostratigraphic units (HSUs) were identified in the \\ntwo soil borings and categorized as HSU 1 through HSU 5 (Ref. 33, p. 17). HSU 1 begins at the surface and is \\napproximately 15 feet thick (Ref. 33, p. 18). This unit is comprised primarily of silty sand with some calcium \\ncarbonate cement and caliche present (Ref. 33, p. 17). HSU 2 is an approximately four -to eight -foot unit \\ncontaining clay and silt layers (Ref. 33, p. 18). HSU 3 is approximately 60 feet thick and contains layers of fine to \\ncoarse sand with increasing gravel presence at the bottom of the unit (Ref. 33, p. 18). HSU 4 is a 2.5 -to 9-foot \\nunit dominated by clay and silt that contains beds of gravel and sand (Ref. 33, p. 18). HSU 5 extends from the \\nterminus of HSU 4 to the depth of investigation, and is at least 16 feet thick (Ref. 33, p. 19). HSU 5 is comprised \\nof poorly graded sand (Ref. 33, p. 19). The subsurface characterization field event demonstrated that the \\nCarlisle Village Cleaners \\nNMN000622185 10  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n       \\n    \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n     \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n     \\n     \\n   inconsistent and thin clay and silt layers identified in HSU 2 and HSU 4 have not impeded the vertical migration \\nof chlorinated solvent vapor contamination. Additionally, while moist conditions were noted in HSU 2 and HSU \\n4, no evidence of saturation or pe rched groundwater was encountered during the investigation (Ref. 33, p. 25). \\nThe COCs, PCE and TCE, are volatile compounds which are part of a common class of chemicals with known \\nvapor intrusion characteristics (Ref. 29, p. 44) . The subsurface vapors in the vadose zone may travel vertically and \\neventually enter overlying structures as a component of gas by migrating through cracks, seams, interstices, utility \\nconduits, or other gaps in foundations (Ref. 29, pp. 48 -49). \\nIn September 2022, the EPA Removal Program began indoor air monitoring at the five buildings that comprise \\nthe strip mall : ROS 705 – Child Counseling Center, ROS 708 – Coffee Warehouse, ROS 799 – Coffee Office \\nSpace, ROS 707 – Realtor, and ROS 704 – Art St udio (Ref. 40, p. 3 ; Ref. 55, p p. 11, 12). Based on the initial \\nindoor air results, the EPA Removal Program installed twelve air purifying units (APUs) across the five buildings \\nin November 2022 as an interim mitigation measure to protect building occupants , and to mitigate and assess \\nCOC levels at the strip mall properties (Ref. 40, pp. 7-10; Ref. 55, p. 9 ). \\nSite Investigation History \\nThe Carlisle Village Cleaners site was discovered by NMED in 2021 through a n effort to inventory all known \\nhistoric al dry-cleaning operations in the State of New Mexico . The historic al dry cleaners, identified through a \\nrecords review of primary sources ( e.g. city directories, Sanborn maps), were categorized by operation al duration , \\noccupation status of the former facilit ies, and proximity to a sensitive population (Ref. 35, p. 11; Ref. 36, p p. 2-3). \\nFormer operations that appeared likely to pose a threat to human health or the environment based on meeting one \\nor more priority criteria were referred to the NMED Superfund Oversight Section for investigation (Ref . 35, p . 11; \\nRef. 36, p. 4). \\nIn January 2022, the NMED Superfund Oversight Section completed a Pre -Comprehensive Environmental \\nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Screen of the Site. The Pre -CERCLA Screen \\nrecommended a limited investigation to determine if a release of chlorinated solvents had occurred at this location \\n(Ref. 35, pp. 9, 11; Ref. 37, pp. 1, 6). \\nIn May 2022, the NMED Superfund Oversight Section performed the field investigation recommended in the Pre -\\nCERCLA Screen as part of an Abbreviated Preliminary Assessment (Ref. 35, p. 10) . Four passive soil gas \\nsamples (PSG -01 through PSG -04) were deployed along the north and south property boundaries of the South \\nCarlisle Shopping Village strip mall (Ref. 35, pp. 10, 20). PCE was detected at a maximum concentration of \\n188,000 μg/m3 (PSG -04), while TCE was detected at a maximum concentration of 992 μg/m3 (PSG-04) (Ref. 3 5, \\npp. 11, 17; Ref. 38, pp. 65 , 118) . Based on the results of this investigation, NMED recommended immediate \\nresponse by the EPA Removal Program to mitigate vapor intrusion risk for occupants of the South Carlisle \\nShopping Village strip mall and further investigation into the extent of soil vapor contamination, the potential for \\nadditional vapor intrusion exposure , and potential impact of the release on nearby groundwater receptors through \\na Site Inspection (Ref. 35, p. 11). \\nIn September 2022, the EPA Removal Program began indoor air monitoring at the five buildings that comprise \\nthe strip mall : Child Counseling Center, Coffee Warehouse, Coffee Office Space, Realtor, and Art Studio (Ref. \\n40, p. 3 ; Ref. 55, p. 11 ). Based on the initial indoor air results, the EPA Removal Program installed twelve \\ncompact, stand -alone indoor APUs across the five buildings in November 2022 (Ref. 40, p p. 7-10). Additional \\nindoor air monitoring events to evaluate the effectiveness of the APUs occurred in November 2022, January 2023 \\n(sub-slab only), February 2023, April 2023, May 2023 , and July 2023 (Ref. 40, pp. 11, 14-20; Ref. 41, pp. 5-6, 8, \\n12). The maximum PCE concentration detected in indoor air at the strip mall was 3,160 μg/m3 (lab sample ID \\nL1622198 -03) in May 2023, while the maximum PCE concentration detected in sub -slab soil vapor at the strip \\nCarlisle Village Cleaners \\nNMN000622185 11  \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n     \\n    \\n \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n  \\n     \\n      \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n       \\n \\n    mall was 6,990,000 μg/m3 (lab sample ID L1578917 -03) in January 2023 (Ref. 60, pp. 143, 444 ; Ref. 61, pp. 165, \\n673; Ref. 62 , p. 10; Ref. 63, p p. 4, 10). The EPA Removal Program also collected water and sludge samples from \\na separator tank connected to two floor drains within the former L&M Laundry and Cleaners (3607 Simms \\nAvenue SE) (Ref. 40, pp. 8 -10). The analytical r esults identified 1.1 μg/L of PCE in water, and no PCE in the \\nunderlying sludge (Ref. 42, pp. 3, 5). \\nTo obtain a preliminary idea of the horizontal extent of vapor contamination, and to identify structures at risk of \\nvapor intrusion based on soil vapor contaminant concentrations in public right -of-way, the EPA Removal \\nProgram conducted three passive soil gas sampling events in January, May, and June 2023 (Ref. 40, pp. 21 -26; \\nRef. 41, pp. 7 -9; Ref. 43, pp. 1,332 -1,335; Ref. 44, pp. 733 -734; Ref. 45, pp. 1,040 -1,042 ). In total, 122 passive \\nsoil gas samplers were installed within a 1,000 -foot radius of the Site (Ref. 43, pp. 1,332 -1,335 ; Ref. 44, pp. 733 -\\n734; Ref. 45, pp. 1,040 -1,042; Ref. 46, p. 4). The maximum de tected PCE concentration was 62,800 μg/m3 (Ref. \\n44, p. 21). The results indicate d that the highest concentrations of PCE in soil vapor were located between the \\nbounds of Carlisle Boulevard SE to the west, Thaxton Avenue SE to the south, Hermosa Dr SE to the east, and \\nthe alleyway just north of the strip mall to the north , correlating with a historic al release or releases at the South \\nCarlisle Shopping Village strip mall . The results further indicated that the soil vapor contamination has migrated \\nradially in all directions, with detectable PCE concentrations found at the 1,000 -foot boundary in most samples \\n(Ref. 46, p. 4). \\nIn October 2023, the NMED Superfund Oversight Section performed a residential structures/sensitive population \\nvapor intrusion sampling event as part of a Site Inspection. NMED collected indoor air and crawl space vapor \\nsamples at 18 single family and multi -family residential structures and at one daycare facility. Eighteen of the 19 \\nsampled structures had measurable levels of PCE in crawl space air, and all 19 sampled structures had measurable \\nlevels of PCE in indoor air (Ref. 8 , pp. 8-36, 2,409-2,412; Ref. 9, pp. 8 -31, 1 ,402-1,404). The maximum PCE \\nconcentration found within the living space of a residential structure (ROS -709-42) was 210 μg/m3, while the \\nmaximum PCE concentration found within a residential crawl space (ROS -709-22) was 190 μg/m3 (Ref. 8, pp. 11, \\n30; Ref. 39, p. 34 ). \\nIn November and December of 2023, the EPA Removal Program performed a commercial structures vapor \\nintrusion sampling event. EPA collected indoor air, crawl space, and sub -slab soil vapor samples at 13 structures \\n(ROSs 203, 320A, 398, 704, 705, 707, 708, 799, 801, 803, 806, 901, 927) , including the five buildings that \\ncomprise the South Carlisle Shopping Village strip mall and two religious institution structures (Ref. 47; Ref. 48). \\nAll 13 sampled structures had measurable levels of PCE in indoor air (Ref. 1 2, pp. 8, 12, 771, 780, 835, 844 ; Ref. \\n13, pp. 106, 111, 571, 573, 618, 621 ; Ref. 14 , pp. 7, 11, 422, 434, 471, 483 ; Ref. 15 , pp. 110, 115, 513, 516, 556, \\n559; Ref. 16 , pp. 98, 102, 1648, 1658, 1722, 1733 ; Ref. 17 , pp. 98, 102, 734, 737, 746, 800, 803, 811 ). The \\nmaximum indoor air PCE concentration found within a structure not associated with the strip mall was 1,760 \\nμg/m3 in ROS 801, while the maximum sub -slab soil gas PCE concentration measured was 593,000 μg/m3 under \\nROS 801 (Ref. 13, pp. 571, 618; Ref. 20, pp. 4, 20 ; Ref. 49, p. 1,073 ). \\nIn November and December of 2023, NMED , through environmental services contractor I NTERA Incorporated \\n(INTERA), performed subsurface characterization activities at the Site (Ref. 33, p. 13). The objective s of the \\ncharacterization were to determine whether perched groundwater or dense non -aqueous phase liquid was present \\nbetween ground surface and 100 feet below ground surface ; to characterize lithology; to measure contaminant \\nconcentrations in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater; and to install nested soil vapor monitor wells (Ref. 33, p. 7). \\nNo perched groundwater, DNAPL, or significant fine-grain ed confining units were identified (Ref. 33, p. 25). Soil \\nsamples, which were collected during boring advancement , demonstrated a maximum PCE concentration of 1.3 \\nmg/kg (SVMW -02) at the 80 -to-82-foot depth interval (Ref. 33, p. 39). Soil vapor samples were collected from \\nmultiple intervals within the two developed soil vapor monitor wells. The maximum PCE concentration detected \\nin a vapor well (SVMW -01) was 7,100,000 μg/m3 at 83 feet below ground surface (Ref. 33, p. 40). \\nCarlisle Village Cleaners \\nNMN000622185 12  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n         \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n  5.0 SOIL EXPOSURE AND SUBSURFACE INTRUSION PATHWAY \\n5.2 SUBSURFACE INTRUSION COMPONENT \\nThe origin of chlorinated solvent contamination at the Site is historic al dry-cleaning operations a t the South Carlisle \\nShopping Village strip mall. PCE became the most frequently used dry cleaning solvent beginning in the 1940s. Based on \\nthe operational history of each of the two dry cleaner s and the years in operation ( Carlisle Village Cleaners from 1953 to \\n1975 and L&M Laundry and Cleaners from 1969 to 2017 ), it is likely that both operations used PCE as the primary dry -\\ncleaning solvent ( Ref. 26, pp. 1 -2; Ref. 30 ). Historic al dry-cleaning operations are often the source of environmental \\nreleases of chlorinated solvents due to the absence of pollution prevention controls on historic al dry-cleaning machines or \\nimproper storage and waste disposal practices at historic al facilities (Ref. 26, p. 2; Ref. 27, pp. 8, 20 -21). A release of PCE \\nat the South Carlisle Shopping Village strip mall was confirmed based on soil vapor sampling during the May 2022 \\nAbbreviated Prel iminary Assessment field event (NMED) (Ref. 35 , pp. 6, 10, 11). The identification of the South Carlisle \\nShopping Village strip mall as the source of the release of PCE was further s upported by the January /May/ June 2023 \\npassive soil gas sampling events (EPA) ( Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record ; Ref. 39, p. 39; Ref. 46, p. 4). TCE, a \\ndegradation product of PCE, was also identified in soil vapor and , along with PCE , is a Site contaminant o f concern (Ref. \\n32; Ref. 35, pp. 9, 10, 11, 17; Ref. 46, p. 3). \\nDuring the NMED November/December 2023 subsurface characterization field event , Site geology to 105 feet below \\nground surface was characterized during the drilling and installation of two soil vapor monitor wells (SVMW -01 and \\nSVMW -02). Within the first 105 feet, five hydro stratigraphic units (HSUs) were identified in the two soil borings and \\ncategorized as HSU 1 through HSU 5 (Ref. 33, p. 17) . HSU 1 begins at the surface and is approximately 15 feet thick \\n(Ref. 33, p. 18) . This unit is comprised primarily of silt y sand with some calcium carbonate cement and caliche present \\n(Ref. 33, p. 1 7). HSU 2 is an approximately four -to eight -foot unit containing clay and silt layers (Ref. 33, p. 18) . HSU 3 \\nis approximately 60 feet thick and contains layers of fine to coarse sand with increasing gravel presence at the bottom of \\nthe unit (Ref. 33, p. 18). HSU 4 is a 2.5 -to 9-foot unit dominated by clay and silt that contai ns beds of gravel and sand \\n(Ref. 33, p. 18). HSU 5 extends from the terminu s of HSU 4 to the depth of investigation, and is at least 16 feet thick (Ref. \\n33, p. 19). HSU 5 is comprised of poorly graded sand (Ref. 33, p. 19). The subsurface characterization field event \\ndemonstrated that the inconsistent and thin clay and silt layers identified in HSU 2 and HSU 4 have not impeded the \\nvertical migration of chlorinated solvent vapor contamination. Additionally, while moist conditions were noted in HSU 2 \\nand HSU 4, no evidence of saturation or perched groundwater was encountered during the investigation (Ref. 33, p. 25). \\nPCE and TCE belong to a class of chemicals with known vapor intrusion characteristics (Ref. 29, p. 44). The subsurface \\nsource of vapor -forming chemicals, which has so far been identified as a soil vapor contamination within the vadose zone , \\nhas migrated radially in all directions from the strip mall via gaseous diffusion through coarse -grained geologic materials \\nas demonstrated by the January/May/June 2023 passive soil gas sampling events (EPA) (Ref. 29, pp. 41, 46 ; Ref. 33, pp. \\n17-19; Ref. 46, pp. 3-4). Additionally, d uring the November/December 2023 subsurface characterization field event \\n(NMED), active soi l vapor samples from two Site soil vapor monitor wells (SVMW -01 and SVMW -02) have \\ndemonstrated PCE concentrations in the vadose zone ranging from 230,000 µg/m3 to 7,100,000 µg/m3 between four feet \\nand 91 feet below ground surface (Ref. 33, p. 40) . Hazardous vapors in the vadose zone can enter overlying structures as a \\ncomponent of gas by migrating through cracks, seams, interstices, utility conduits, or other gaps in foundations (Ref. 29, \\npp. 48 -49). The area overlying the known boundaries of the so il vapor contamination consists of a dense array of single \\nfamily and multi -family residential neighbor hoods with some light commercial activity in the near Site vicinity. \\nResidential structures in this area are constructed with an underlying crawlspace wi thout a radon or vapor mitigation \\nsystem, and commercial structures are constructed with a slab -on-grade foundation (Ref. 31; Ref. 46, p. 4; Ref. 65). Based \\non tax assessor records, the residential structures surrounding the Site were primarily built between 1946 and 1951 with \\nunderlying crawlspaces (Ref. 4, pp. 1 -3). \\nCarlisle Village Cleaners \\nNMN000622185 13  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n        \\n    \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n                \\n  \\n                  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n     \\n    \\n         \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n     \\n     \\n \\n  5.2.0 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS \\nThere is one identified area of observed exposure (AOE), or area containing structures with indoor air contamination due \\nto subsurface intrusion, at the Site as shown in Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record .

There are three unoccupied commercial structures ( given ROS numbers 398, 711, and 802 for \\ntracking purposes ), and five multi -family residential subunits located above the ground floor (subunits of ROS 118, 202, \\nand 808), which were not included in HRS calculations (for HRS purposes, only regularly occupied structures are eligible \\nfor scoring; in multi -story, multi -subunit, regularly occupied structures, only subunits on a level with observed exposure \\nsamples and levels below are considered to be within an AOE; also , for multi -subunit structures inferred to be in an AOE, \\nonly regularly occupied subunits on the lowest level of the structure are counted as part of the AOE. [Ref. 1, Se ction \\n5.2.0]) . Although ROS 398 was not scored because it was vacant, it exhibited PCE concentrations that would meet \\nobserved exposure criteria and exceeded the cancer risk screening concentration benchmark. The boundaries of AOE 1 \\nwere determined by establishing observed exposure to PCE through indoor air sampling at 33 regularly occupied \\nstructures or subunits (see observed exposure information in Tables 5 and 6 below of this HRS documentation record ). An \\nadditional 71 regularly occupied structures or subunits have inferred contamination based on their location between \\nstructures with observed contamination (see inferred structures identified in Table 20 below of this HRS documentation \\nrecord ) (Ref. 4, p. 1 -3; Figure 2 and Table 1 of this HRS documentation record ). All structures are located within a 600-\\nfoot radius of the location of the former dry cleaners (Ref. 39, p. 21; Ref. 46, pp. 3-4; Figure 2 of this HRS documentation \\nrecord ).

Together, EPA -led and NMED -led field \\ninvestigations have resulted in the collection of indoor air samples at 11 single -family residential structures , 11 multi -\\nfamily subunits, 12 commercial structures , and two reli gious institution structur es. Residential samples were collected \\nover a 24 -hour period, while commercial samples were collected over an 8 -hour period. The exception was ROS 305 \\nwhich is a residential structure operating as a commercial business, so samples were collected as a residential structure. \\nSamples were collected using individually certified evacuated canisters equipped with flow controllers. All samples were \\nanalyzed by EPA Method Toxic Organics -15 Low Level ( Ref. 6, p. 12; Ref. 7, p p. 6-7, 21, 23 ; Ref. 8, p. 6; Ref. 9, p. 6; \\nRef. 12, p. 906; Ref. 13, p. 6 89; Ref. 14, p. 539; Ref. 15, p. 636; Ref. 16, p. 1 ,792; Ref. 17, p. 873 ; Ref. 47, p. 8; Ref. 48, \\npp. 6-7; Ref. 54, pp. 1 -3; Ref. 55, pp. 11 -12). \\nAll but one structure (ROS 305 , background sample location) of the 36 sampled structures measured indoor air \\nconcentrations of PCE above the laboratory reporting limit . Twenty -four of the structures measured indoor air \\nconcentrations above the HRS cancer risk subsurface intrusion component benchmark of 1.08E -02 mg/m3 (equivalent to \\n10.8 µg/m3) (Ref. 2, p. 2). \\nEstablishment of Background Levels \\nTo document that indoor air contamination levels are significantly above background levels, an indoor air sample was \\ncollected that established a background concentration for affected structures. The background indoor air sample was \\ncollected from ROS 305 during the October 2023 Site Inspection sampling event (NMED) using an individually certified \\nevacuated canister equipped with a 24 -hour flow controller. The sample was analyzed by EPA Method Toxic Organics -15 \\nLow Level (Ref. 9, p. 30). ROS 305 is located at the edge of the known boundary of the soil vapor contamination \\nexhibited by passive soil gas sampling (Ref. 46, p. 4; Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record ). Of the 37 sub -slab or \\ncrawlspace samples collected , the crawlspace sample from ROS 305 is the one sample result below detection limits for \\nPCE (Ref. 9, p. 31; Ref. 11 , pp. 2 -3). \\nROS 305 is similar in construction to other residential structures in the Site vicinity , with all sampled residential structures \\nbeing constructed with wood -frame, cinder block, or stucco with a crawl space (Ref. 31 , pp. 1 -2, 7-8, 13 -14, 19 -20, 25 -26, \\n31-32, 37 -38, 43 -44, 49 -50, 55 -56, 61 -62, 67 -68, 73 -74, 79 -80, 85 -86, 91 -92, 97 -98, 103 -104, 109 -110). One commerci al\\nstructure, 320A, was converted from a residential structure and is similar in construction to the residential structures in t he\\nSite vicinity with a crawlspace. All other commercial sampled structures were built with a slab -on-grade foundation (Ref .\\n65, pp. 1 -2, 9, 18-19, 26 -27, 34 -35, 42 -43, 50 -51, 74 -75, 82-83, 95 -96). A specific commercial structure was not select ed\\nfor background comparison because all commercial structures in the immediate Site vicinity are within the AOE and ar e\\nsituated above the area of soil vapor contamination, as exhibited by passive soil gas sampling (Figure s 2 and 3 of thi s\\nHRS documentation record and Ref. 46, p. 4).\\nTABLE 2 – AOE 1 BACKGROUND LOCATIONS \\nField \\nSample ID ROS ID, Sample \\nLocation Start Date Start \\nTime End Date End \\nTime Basis for Sample as \\nBackground References \\nROS -305-\\n41 ROS -305, Indoor , \\nbathroom in NW \\ncorner of building 10/26/23 15:34 10/27/23 12:37 Outside AOE , \\nSimilar Structure Figure 2; Ref. 6, p. \\n12; Ref. 7, pp. 21, \\n23 \\nTABLE 3 – AOE 1 BACKGROUND SAMPLE CONCENTRATIONS \\nField Sample \\nID Eligible Hazardous \\nSubstances Conc entration \\n(µg/m3) Reporting Limit \\n(µg/m3) References \\nROS -305-41 Tetrachloroethene 0.44 J 0.55 Ref. 9, pp. 7, 30, 174 -179, 1 ,404; Ref. 11, pp. \\n1-9\\nµg/m3 – Micrograms per cubic meter \\nCarlisle Village Cleaners \\n18 NMN000622185  \\n \\n     \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n     \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n       \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   J -Result is less than the reporting limit but greater than or equal to the method detection limit and the concentration is an \\napproximate value ; no bias is associated with this result (Ref. 9, p. 5 ; Ref. 11, p. 5 ).

PCE is a man -made \\nsubstance, and no other sources of PCE are known to be in the immediate Site vicinity (Ref. 50). Prior to the October \\n2023 Site Inspection sampling event , NMED requested that property occupants remove anthropogenic sources of \\nchlorinated solvents that could interfere with the air sample results (Ref. 39, p. 14) . \\nThe detection limit for the background sample is identified as the reporting limit, which is defined for this analysis as the \\nlowest concentration at which an analyte can be reliably measured and reported without qualification. The reporting limit \\nis adjus ted for sample size, dilution, and matrix interference (Ref. 9, p p. 5, 6, 31; Ref. 11, p. 5 ). This definition is the same \\nas the HRS definition for Sample Qua ntitation Limit (SQL) , which is the quantity of a substance that can be reasonably \\nquantified give n the limits of detection for the methods of analysis and sample characteristics that may affect quantitation \\n(for example: dilution, concentratio n) (Ref. 1, Section 1.1). The terms can be used interchangeably in this context. \\nThe background sample and residential observed exposure samples were collected during the same sampling event, by the \\nsame sampling team, using the same sampling technique and over a similar, approximately 24 -hour period (see Figure 2 \\nof this HRS documentation record for background location). The commercial and religious structures observed exposure \\nsamples were collected approximately one month later using the same sampling technique over a similar, approximately \\n8-hour period. \\nTABLE 4 – AOE 1 BACKGROUND LEVELS \\nEligible Hazardous Substance Background Level ( µg/m3) Concentrations used for Establishing an Observed \\nExposure ( µg/m3) \\nTetrachloroethene 0.44 J ≥ 1.32 \\nµg/m3 – Micrograms per cubic meter \\nJ -Result is less than the reporting limit but greater than or equal to the method detection limit and the concentration is an \\napproximate value (Ref. 9, p. 5). \\nExposure Samples \\nIndoor air concentrations of PCE greater than or equal to three times the background level of 0.44 micrograms per cubic \\nmeter (μg/m3), an observed release criterion of 1.32 μg/m3, and attributable to Site subsurface contamination establish an \\nobserved exposure (Ref. 1, Table 2 -3). \\nDuring the October 2023 Site Inspection sampling event (NMED) , ambient, backgrou nd, indoor, and sub -structure air \\nsamples were collected over a 24 -hour period.

Two historic al dry cleaners operated at the South \\nCarlisle Shopping Village strip mall. According to Albuquerque city directory records , Carlisle Village Cleaners operated \\nas a dry cleaner at 3611 Simms Avenue SE from 1953 to 1975 (Ref. 30, pp. 1- 3, 10- 11). L&M Laundry and Cleaners \\noperated as a dry cleaner at 3607 Simms Avenue SE from 196 9 to 2017 (Ref. 30, pp. 8- 9, 15- 17). \\nBefore the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act was promulgated in November 1980, there was little regulation or \\noversight over hazardous wastes generated at dry cleaning operations (Ref. 27, p. 16) . During the operational period of the \\ntwo historic al dry cleaners (Carlisle Village Cleaners from 1953 to 1975 and L&M Laundry and Cleaners from 1969 to \\n2017) , dry-cleaning machine technology was still evolving (Ref. 26, p. 2). Between the 1920s and 1960s, “first -generation \\nmachines”, also known as transfer machines , were the mos t common dry-cleaning machine in use (Ref. 27, p p. 6, 7). \\nBecause first -generation machines required the operator to manually transfer garments between the washer and tumbler, \\nsolvent vapor release was common (Ref. 27, p. 6). “Second -generation machines”, also known as vented dry -to-dry \\nmachines, allowed for garments to be cleaned in a single machine (Ref. 27, p. 7 ). By the time third -generation, or closed -\\nloop machines , were introduced in the late 1970s, more dry -cleaning machines were equipped with early pollution \\nprevention controls , including carbon adsorption units and refrigerated condensers to recover solvent from vapors (Ref. \\n27, p. 7 -8). In addition, first -and second -generation dry -cleaning machines had low “solvent mileage” and required much \\nhigher quantities of PCE to clean a unit of clothing than machines introduced later (Ref. 26, p. 2; Ref. 27, p. 8). \\nBesides machine limitations and poor housekeeping practices, the relatively high vapor pressure and vapor density of PCE \\ncan cause PCE vapors to emanate from storage containers in indoor, confined spaces and, w ith restricted air flow, the \\ndense PCE vapors can penetrate concrete flooring and enter the upper vadose zone to form a “vapor cloud” (Ref. 66, p. 1). \\nContinued density -derived pressure can move PCE vapors further into the subsurface to where gaseous diffusion begins to \\ncontrol the movement of subsurface vapors (Ref. 66, p. 1). “Vapor clouds” reaching tens of feet into the upper vadose \\nzone have been documented without corresponding soil contamination (Ref. 66, p. 1). Dry cleaners are a known \\ncommercial operation susceptible to this contaminant transport m echanism (Ref. 66, p. 1). \\nIt is estimated that in 1962, when PCE became the preferred solvent in dry -cleaning operations in the United States , \\napproximately 90% of PCE consumed was by the dry -cleaning industry (Ref. 28, p. 3). In 1990, approximately 50% of the \\nPCE consumed in the United States was by the dry -cleaning and textile processing industry (Ref. 28, p. 5 ). \\nEvidence of PCE Migration from the South Carlisle Shopping Village Strip Mall to Below Contaminated Structures \\nDuring the January/May/June 2023 passive soil gas sampling events (EPA), 122 passive soil gas samplers were deployed \\nwithin a 1,000 -foot radius of the strip mall to provide an initial evaluation of the horizontal extent of the soil vapor \\ncontamination (Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record ; Ref. 40, pp. 21 -26; Ref. 41, pp. 7 -9; Ref. 43, pp. 1,332 -1,335; \\nRef. 44, pp. 733 -734; Ref. 45, pp. 1,040 -1,042; Ref. 46, p. 4). The results indicated that the highest concentrations of PCE \\nin soil vapor were located between the bounds of Carlisle Boulevard SE to the west, Thaxton Avenue SE to the south, \\nHermosa Dr SE to the east, and the alleyway just north of the strip mall to the north, correlating with a historical release or \\nreleases at the South Carlisle Shopping Village st rip mall. The results further indicated that the soil vapor contamination \\nhas migrated radially in all directions , with detectable PCE concentrations found at the 1,000 -foot boundary in most \\nsamples (Ref. 39, pp. 39 -40; Ref. 46, p. 4). The November/December 2023 subsurface characterization event (NMED) \\nconfirmed that the first 10 5 feet of the Site subsurface consists mostly of sand units, with thin and intermittent fine -\\ngrained units present in two hydrostratigraphic units (Ref. 33, pp. 13, 17 -19). The coarse -grained geologic materials allow \\nsubsurface vapor to migrate radially in all directions via gaseous diffusion (Ref. 29, p. 46 ; Ref. 33, pp. 17 -19). \\nAdditionally, there are 37 sub -slab or crawlspace samples corresponding to 27 sampled structures. Of these, 36 sample \\nresults exhibited PCE detections for 26 corresponding structures, with the highest detections occurring in sub -slab \\nCarlisle Village Cleaners \\nNMN000622185 24  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n       \\n      \\n   \\n     \\n      \\n   \\n     \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n      \\n    \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n      \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n     \\n   \\n    samples. For both sub -slab samples and crawlspace samples, structures closer to the strip mall generally exhibited higher \\ndetections of PCE. The one sample result below detection limits for PCE was collected from the crawlspace beneath ROS \\n305, the structu re from which a background indoor air sample was collected, and located at the edge of the known \\nboundary of the soil vapor contamination (Ref. 8, pp. 8 -15, 18, 24; Ref. 9, pp. 8, 9, 12 -17, 27 -29, 31; Ref. 10; Ref. 11; \\nRef. 12, p. 777; Ref. 19, p. 16; Ref. 49, pp. 11, 15, 19, 22, 26, 30; Ref. 67, pp. 11, 16, 21, 26; Ref. 68, pp. 9, 13, 17, 21; \\nRef. 69, pp. 9, 14, 19, 24; Ref. 70, pp. 8, 12, 16, 20; Ref. 71, pp. 8, 12, 16, 19, 23, 27 ; Figure 3 of this HRS documentation \\nrecord ). \\nThe pattern of subsurface contamination points to both former dry cleaners collectively as the origin of contamination. It \\nis not possible to determine which facility the contamination originated at due to the proximity of the former facilities, the \\ncomingling of contamination over time, the lack of records concerning historic spills or releases, and the amount of time \\nthat has elapsed since the release, or releases, took place. \\nLack of Structural Containment Permanently Preventing Vapor Intrusion \\nHazardous vapors in the vadose zone can enter overlying structures as a component of gas by migrating through cracks, \\nseams, interstices, utility conduits, or other gaps in foundations (Ref. 29, pp. 48 -49). During the NMED October 2023 Site \\nInspection sampling event, it was noted that all sampled residential structures were wood -frame , cinder block , or stucco \\nstructures with crawl spaces (Ref. 31). None of the sampled residential structures had radon mitigation or vapor or \\nmoisture barriers in place (Ref. 31) . During November/December 2023 commercial vapor intrusion sampling event \\n(EPA), the sampled commercial structures were recorded as wood -frame, cinder block, stucco, or brick structures (Ref. \\n65). All but one commercial sampled structure (ROS -320A , built over a crawl space ) was constructed with a slab -on-\\ngrade foundation (Ref. 65 , p. 9 ). None of the commercial sampled structures were equipped with a radon mitigation or \\nsub-slab vapor or moisture barrier . The five commercial sampled structures that comprise the South Carlisle Shopping \\nVillage strip mall (ROS 705 – Child Counseling Center, ROS 708 – Coffee Warehouse, ROS 799 – Coffee Office Space, \\nROS 707 – Realtor, and ROS 704 – Art Studio ) have been provide d with indoor air purifying units ; however , although \\nsuch units reduce contaminant concentrations in indoor air, they do not prevent initial intrusion of vapors into structures \\n(Ref. 40, pp. 7-10; Ref. 65). Based on tax assessor records, the residential neighborhood within A OE 1 was primarily built \\nbetween 1946 and 1951 while the sampled commercial structures were built between 1949 and 1975 (Ref. 4 , pp. 1 -3). \\nConsideration of Anthropogenic Sources \\nOne week prior to the October 2023 Site Inspection sampling event (NMED) , NMED field personnel visited with each \\nproperty owner or occupant to discuss preparing the structure for the sampling event (Ref. 7, pp. 2-10; Ref. 31). NMED \\nrequested that potential anthropogenic sources of the Site contaminants of concern be temporarily relocated to an outdoor \\nshed, sealed -off garage, or other location prior to the indoor air sampling event to minimize the influence of \\nanthropogenic sources on indoor air quality (Ref. 7, pp. 2-10; Ref. 39, p. 14 ). \\nIn November 2023, the EPA Removal Program conducted building surveys for commercial structures to be sampled and \\nvisited with property owners prior to collecting indoor air samples. EPA identified and assisted with relocating potential \\nanthropogenic sources prior to indoor air sampling (Ref. 48, pp. 6, 8-9; Ref. 55 pp. 14 -15; Ref. 65, pp. 1, 6, 10, 15, 18, 23, \\n26, 31, 34, 39, 42, 47, 50, 55, 58, 63, 66, 71, 74, 79, 82, 87, 95, 100). \\nFour structures or subunits, ROS 221, 702F, 801, and 901, still had chemicals that potentially contained VOCs present \\nwithin the structure during indoor air sampling . The cleaning chemicals present within ROS 801 were kept in a closet that \\nremained closed during sampling (Ref. 31 , pp. 49, 109, 114; Ref. 47, p. 13 ; Ref. 48, p. 9; Ref. 65, pp. 58, 63, 82, 87). Four \\nindoor air samples (L2370885 -01 through L23 70885 -04) were collected from various locations in ROS 801 and exhibited \\nsimilar concentrations of PCE (Ref. 13, pp. 2, 10, 14, 18, 22; Ref. 20, pp. 8, 12, 16, 20; Ref. 65, p. 58, 65). Samples \\ncollected from subunits nearby to ROS 702F in the same apartment complex exhibited similar concentrations of PCE \\n(Ref. 8, pp. 25, 31, 34, 35, 36; Ref. 9, p. 24 ). All four structures or subunits have corresponding sub -slab or crawlspace \\nsamples that exhibited detecti ons of PCE , with significantly higher concentrations detected beneath ROS 801 and 901 \\n(which have slab -on-grade foundations) compared to indoor air samples (Ref. 8, p p. 8, 18; Ref. 49, pp. 15, 19, 22, 26). \\nCarlisle Village Cleaners \\nNMN000622185 25  \\n \\n      \\n      \\n   \\n \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n     \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n   Additionally, passive soil gas sampling indicates that all four structures or subunits are located above the area of PCE-\\ncontaminated soil vapor (Ref. 46, p. 4). This indicates the primary pathway of PCE contamination appears to be from soil \\nvapor contamination below the structures or subunits, and it is unlikely that potentially -VOC -containing chemicals \\nsignificantly contributed to the indoor air PCE concentrations in these sampled structures or subunits . \\nConsideration of Ambient Air Contamination \\nOutdoor, ambient air sampling was conducted during each day of indoor air sampling activities during the October 2023 \\nSite Inspection sampling event (NMED) and November/December 2023 Integrated Assessment sampling event (EPA) to \\ncharacterize background, am bient air quality in the Site vicinity and to assess the influence of potential ambient air \\ncontamination on indoor air quality. Four ambient air samples were collected during the October 2023 Site Inspection \\nsampling event (NMED). The analytical results i dentified trace concentrations of PCE in three samples (ROS -221-11 \\n[0.28  μg/m3], ROS -314-11 [0.33 μg/m3], and ROS -317-11 [0.37 μg/m3], all J -flagged) and one PCE concentration of 1.7 \\nμg/m3 in ROS -701-11 (Ref. 8, p. 26; Ref. 9, pp. 11, 21, 26). Two ambient air samples (Lab ID: L2371216 -02 and \\nL2371216 -03) were collected during the November/December Integrated Assessment sampling event (EPA). The \\nanalytical results identified ambient air PCE concentrations of 1.34 μg/m3 (J-flagged) and 2.10 μg/m3 (Ref. 14, p. 474, \\n477). \\nThere are 37 sub-slab or crawlspace samples corresponding to 27 sampled structures. Of these, 36 sample results \\nexhibited PCE detections for 26 corresponding structures, with the highest detections occurring in sub -slab samples. For \\nboth sub -slab samples and crawlspace samples, structures closer to the strip mall generally exhibited higher detections of \\nPCE. The one sample result below detection limits for PCE was collected from the crawlspace beneath ROS 305, the \\nstructure from which a background indoor ai r sample was collected, and located at the edge of the known boundary of the \\nsoil vapor contamination (Ref. 8, pp. 8 -15, 18, 24; Ref. 9, pp. 8, 9, 12 -17, 27 -29, 31 ; Ref. 10; Ref. 11; Ref. 12, p. 777; Ref. \\n19, p. 16; Ref. 49, pp. 11, 15, 19, 22, 26, 30; Ref. 67, pp. 11, 16, 21, 26; Ref. 68, pp. 9, 13, 17, 21; Ref. 69, pp. 9, 14, 19, \\n24; Ref. 70, pp. 8, 12, 16, 20; Ref. 71, pp. 8, 12, 16, 19, 23, 27 ; Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record ). This matches \\nthe pattern of PCE contamination exhibited by the pas sive soil gas sampling (Ref. 46, p. 4). Additionally, as shown in \\nFigure 3 of this HRS documentation record, many of the soil gas and sub -slab samples exhibited very elevated \\nconcentrations in the subsurface throughout the AOE (points showing levels at or above 1,000 μg/m3 are found throughout \\nthe AOE). This indicates the primary pathway of PCE contamination appears to be from soil vapor contamination below \\nthe structures or subunits, and it is unlikely that outdoor air is significantly contributing to the elevated levels of indoor air \\nPCE concen trations seen at the Site. \\nCarlisle Village Cleaners \\nNMN000622185 26  \\n \\n      \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n            \\n  \\n   \\n            \\n   \\n   \\n \\n               \\n \\n   \\n \\n             \\n  \\n   \\n \\n             \\n         \\n \\n   \\n \\n             \\n         \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n            \\n    \\n             \\n   \\n             \\n   \\n             \\n   \\n             \\n  \\n              \\n         \\n   \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   TABLE 7 – AOE 1 AMBIENT AIR ATTRIBUTION SAMPLE LOCATIONS \\nLab Sample \\nID Field Sample ID Sample Location Start Date Start Time End Date End Time References \\n140-34215 -\\n19ROS -701-11 Ambient air, \\noutside of \\nROS 10/23/23 12:53 10/24/23 09:40 Ref. 6, p. 25; Ref. 7, p p. 11, 13; Ref. 8, \\np. 7\\n140-34216 -4 ROS -317-11 Ambient air, \\noutside of \\nROS 10/24/23 12:54 10/25/23 09:39 Ref. 6, p. 16; Ref. 7, pp. 13, 15; Ref. 9, \\np. 7\\n140-34216 -\\n19ROS -221-11 Ambient air, \\noutside of ROS 10/25/23 12:53 10/26/23 09:43 Ref. 6, p. 6; Ref. 7, pp. 16, 19; Ref. 9, p. \\n7 \\n140-34216 -\\n14ROS -314-11 Ambient air, \\noutside of \\nROS 10/26/23 12:39 10/27/23 09:41 Ref. 6, p. 13; Ref. 7, pp. 20, 22; Ref. 9, \\np. 7\\nL2371216 -02 CVC -AA-OD-\\n1-20231130 -1Outdoors, \\neast of ROS \\n801 11/30/23 8:56 11/30/23 16:08 Ref. 14, pp. 7 , 11; Ref. 47, pp. 13 , 14; \\nRef. 48, p. 10; Ref. 54, p. 1; Ref . 55, pp. \\n19-20\\nL2371216 -03 CVC -AA-OD-\\n1-20231201 -1Outdoors, east of ROS \\n801 12/1/23 7:40 12/1/23 14:09 Ref. 14, pp. 7 , 11; Ref. 47, pp. 15 , 18; \\nRef. 48, p. 10; Ref. 54, p. 2; Ref. 55, pp. \\n19-20\\nTABLE 8 – AOE 1 AMBIENT AIR ATTRIBUTION SAMPLE CONCENTRATIONS \\nLab Sample \\nID Field Sample ID Hazardous Substance Concentration (µg/m\\n3) Reporting Limit (µg/m\\n3) References \\n140-34215 -\\n19ROS -701-11 Tetrachloroethene 1.7 0.56 Ref. 8, pp. 7, 26, 163 -167, 2 ,411; Ref. \\n10, pp. 1 -10 \\n140-34216 -4 ROS -317-11 Tetrachloroethene 0.37 J 0.54 Ref. 9, pp. 7, 11, 76 -80, 1 ,402; Ref. \\n11, pp. 1 -9 \\n140-34216 -\\n19ROS -221-11 Tetrachloroethene 0.28 J 0.58 Ref. 9, pp. 7, 26, 154 -158, 1 ,404; Ref. \\n11, pp. 1 -9 \\n140-34216 -\\n14ROS -314-11 Tetrachloroethene 0.33 J 0.55 Ref. 9, pp. 7, 21, 129 -133, 1 ,403; Ref. \\n11, pp. 1 -9 \\nL2371216 -02 CVC -AA-OD-\\n1-20231130 -1Tetrachloroethene 2.1 1.36 Ref. 14, pp. 7, 11, 425, 474; Ref. 23, p. 10\\nL2371216 -03 CVC -AA-OD-\\n1-20231201 -1Tetrachloroethene 1.34 JQK* 1.36 Ref. 14, pp. 7, 11, 428, 477; Ref. 21, \\npp. 1, 8, 9; Ref. 23, pp. 2, 4, 13 \\nµg/m3 – Micrograms per cubic meter \\nJ and JQK – Result is less than the reporting limit but greater than or equal to the method detection limit and the \\nconcentration is an approximate value (Ref. 9, p. 5; Ref. 23, pp. 2, 4). \\nLaboratory r eporting limits are adjusted for sample size, dilution, and matrix interference (Ref. 10, p. 6; Ref. 11, p. 5; Ref. \\n14, p. 540) and are equivalent to SQL as defined in HRS Section 1.1, Definitions. \\nConsideration of Other Possible Sources of PCE \\nIn 2021, NMED catalogued all historic al dry cleaning, laundry, and laundry supply business in the Albuquerque \\nmetropolitan area by examining City di rectory records (Ref. 36). The listed businesses were plotted on Google Earth and \\nthe locations o f the listed businesses were compared to the extent of known subsurface PCE contamination (Ref. 51). Five \\ninventoried dry cleaners or laundries, including Carlisle Village Cleaners and L&M Laundry and Cleaners, are located \\nabove the extent of subsurface PCE contamination identified in the January/May/June 2023 passive soil gas sampling \\nevents (EPA) (Ref. 46, p. 4 ; Ref. 51 ).

It is unlikely that any of the three listed businesses operated as dry cleaners \\nbased on the City directory records , and therefore unlikely that any of the three businesses used PCE in large enough \\nquantities to substantially contribute to the identified contamination. \\nA search for other possible sources of PCE contamination located within a half -mile of the Site did not identify any \\nfacilities within EPA’s Envirofacts Database (Ref. 50). In addition, the contaminants being scored in this HRS \\ndocumentation record are man -made substances not found naturally in the environment. \\nStructure Containment \\nAs presented above in the AOE, there are 21 residential , 10 commercial , and 2 religious regularly occupied structures or \\nsubunits that have observed exposure documented through chemical analysis and are therefore assigned a containment \\nvalue of 10 (Ref. 1, Table 5 -12). Consistent with HRS Section 5.2.1.1.2.1, for all the regularly occupied structures with \\nunknown containment features , a structure containment value of greater than zero is assigned. \\nTABLE 9 – AOE STRUCTURE CONTAINMENT \\nROS ID Structure Containment \\nFactor Value (Ref. 1, Table \\n5 12) Rationale References \\nROS 118B, 203, 221, 222, 314B, 317A, \\n320A, 413, 602, 620, 701A, 701D, 701H, \\n702A, 702F, 703A, 703F, 704, 705, 707, \\n708, 709, 712, 713, 799, 801, 803, 806, \\n812, 901, 908, 914, 927 10 Evidence of subsurface \\nintrusion with documented \\nobserved exposure See AOE description \\nabove \\nAll other structures in AOE Greater than 0 Unknown containment \\nfeatures Ref. 1, Section \\n5.2.1.1.2.1 \\nAOE Hazardous Waste Quantity \\nTier A – Hazardous Constituent Quantity: \\nThe total hazardous constituent quantity for AOE 1 could not be adequately determined according to the HRS \\nrequirements; that is, the total mass of all Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act \\n(CERCLA) hazardous substances to ha ve entered the structures is not known and cannot be estimated with reasonable \\nconfidence (Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.1 and 5.2.1.2.2).

Site***  September 2024 \\nEXIDE TECHNOLOGIES - VERNON Vernon, California \\nLos Angeles County  \\n\\uf0feSite Location:\\nThe\\n former Exide Technologies – Vernon site (site) is located at 2700 South Indiana Street in the city of Vernon, Los \\nAngeles County, California. The site is situated within an industrial area. The city of Los Angeles is approximately five \\nmiles northwest of the site. \\n\\uf0a1 Site History: \\nThe Exide facility began lead recycling operations in 1922. By 1982, the facility was conducting battery recycling and \\nlead-refining operations where lead-acid batteries were crushed and recycled in a secondary lead smelter system at the \\nsite. Exide operations were terminated in March 201 4. Since 2013, the California Department of Toxic Substances \\nControl (DTSC) has conducted extensive site characterization activities at the site and surrounding areas, including on-\\nsite sampling, off-site sampling, and excavations of residential yards. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy was settled in 2020. \\n\\uf090Site Contamination/Contaminants:  \\nGround water beneath the site is contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE). Three wells considered downgradient from \\nthe site\\n have exhibited historical maximum TCE concentrations above the EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Act Maximum \\nContaminant Level. In addition, lead contamination in soils has been found in the on-site acid pits as well as in the \\nresidential neighborhoods around the site. \\n\\uf094 Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment: \\nTCE is the contaminant of concern and known to be prevalent in area ground water. Residential populations \\npotentially served by impacted drinking water wells range from 133,756 to 459,370 individuals.  \\n\\uf050 Response Activities (to date):  \\nIn 2018, the state began clean-up of soil at residential properties and more than 5,000 properties have been excavated . \\nSince October 2021, the EPA and the DTSC have worked to oversee the actions at the site. Activities completed include \\ndecontaminating and tearing down remaining on-site lead battery processing and smelting buildings and assessing on-\\nsite soil contamination.  \\n\\uf09b Need for NPL Listing: \\nThe state of California referred the site to the EPA for NPL listing to avoid interruptions in site cleanup . TCE \\ncontamination in site groundwater likely is a contributor to area wide TCE contamination found in the Los Angeles \\nBasin. Other federal and state cleanup programs were evaluated but are not viable at this time. The EPA received a letter \\nof support for placing the site on the NPL from the state of California.  \\n[The description of the site (release) is based on information available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS.

The facility is currently undergoing closure activities, is \\nsurrounded by a fence, and is entirely paved, preventing any residual on -site soil contamination \\nfrom being released into the environment, a nd there is no public recreation use (Ref. 7, p.52). \\nWhile there is an estimated population of 6,055 within one mile of the Exide -Vernon facility, there \\nare no residents within 0.5 miles of the facility (Ref. 7, p.52). Based on the results of the \\nbackgroun d soil sampling conducted during the SI, only 15 residential properties were found to \\nhave lead concentrations greater than three times the background level, for a total resident \\npopulation of 44.7 (Ref. 7, p.53). The facility is located within a large ind ustrial area with \\nnumerous nearby potential sources, and there is no conclusive evidence that the facility is the sole \\nsource of lead contamination in the residential area (Ref. 7, p.76). \\nSurface Water Migration Pathway: The nearest major surface water body is the Los Angeles River, \\napproximately 0.15 -miles southwest of the former Exide Technologies – Vernon facility (Ref. 7, \\np. 53, 61 ). On -site surface water runoff is collected in a retention basin and directed to an on -site \\nwastewater treatment plant (Ref. 7, p.97). \\nSubsurface Intrusion Component of the Soil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion Pathway: Based \\non previous soil vapor monitoring conducted at the Exide -Vernon facility, volatized TCE was \\npresent in the subsurface soil, however, structures at the facility have not been occupied since 2014 \\nand are currently being deconstructed (Ref. 7 , p.53). Indoor air samples were collected from both  \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n the engineering building and employee facilities buildings showed that TCE was detected at \\nconcentrations below the commercial indoor air screening level (Ref. 7, p.23) \\nAir Migration Pathway: Historical operations at the former Exide -Vernon facility resulted in lead \\nand other heavy metals being emitted and deposited to the ground and other surfaces at the facility \\nand in the surrounding areas, however, based on air modeling conducted at the site there is no \\nconclusive evidence that the facility is the sole source of lead contamination in the residential area \\n(Ref. 7, p. 54).

EPA lists national priorities among the known \"releases or threatened releases\" of hazardous substances; \\nthus, the focus is on the release, not precisely delineated bou ndaries . A site is defined as where a hazardous substance \\nhas been \"deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has otherwise come to be located.\" Generally, HRS scoring and \\nthe subsequent listing of a release merely represent the initial determination that a certain area may need to be \\naddressed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation & Liability Act (CERCLA ). \\nAccordingly, EPA contemplates that the preliminary description of facility boundaries at the time of scoring will be \\nrefined as more information is developed as to where the contamination has come to be located. \\n1 “Ground water” and “groundwater” are synonymous; the spelling is different due to “ground water” being codified \\nas part of the HRS, while “groundwater” is the modern spelling. \\n1      \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n        \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n       \\n      \\n    \\n   \\n EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\nHAZARD RANKING SYSTEM SUMMARY SCORESHEETS \\nSITE NAME: EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\nCITY/COUNTY/STATE: Vernon, Los Angeles County, California 90058 \\nEPA ID #: CAD097854541 \\nEVALUATOR: Alex Grubb DATE: September 5 , 2024 \\nLATITUDE: 34.005229° N LONGITUDE: -118.193402° W \\nS S2 \\nGround Water Migration Pathway Score (S gw) 95.56 9,131.71 \\nSurface Water Migration Pathway Score (S sw) Not scored Not scored \\nSoil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion Pathway \\nScore (S sessi) Not scored Not scored \\nAir Migration Pathway Score (S a) Not scored Not scored \\n2 2 2Sgw 2 +Ssw + S sessi + S a XXXXXXX 9,131.71 \\n2 2(Sgw 2 +Ssw + S sessi + S a 2) / 4 XXXXXXX 2,282.92 \\n2 2SQRT ((Sgw 2 +Ssw + S sessi + S a 2) / 4) XXXXXXX 47.78 \\n2      \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n    \\n     \\n      \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n             \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n     \\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\nHRS TABLE 3-1 \\nGround Water Migration Component Scoresheet \\nFactor Categories and Factors Maximum \\nValue Value \\nAssigned \\nAquifer Evaluated: Exposition through Jefferson \\nLikelihood of Release to an Aquifer : \\n1.

Ref. 4, p. 9). For Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scoring purposes, the \\n“Site” consists of the release of hazardous substances from former operations associated with the \\nExide facility. Hazardous substances associated with the HRS source includes trichloroethylene \\n(TCE) (see Section 2.2 and subsections o f this HRS documentation record). \\nThe Exide facility began lead recycling operations in 1922. By 1982, the facility was conducting \\nbattery recycling and lead -refining operations in which lead -acid batteries were crushed and \\nrecycled in a secondary lead smelter system at the former Vernon p lant (Ref. 5, p.42). \\nPrevious owners of the facility included Morris P. Kirk & Sons, NL Industries, Gould Inc., and \\nGNB Inc. Exide Technologies , Inc. acquired the property in 2000, and continued operations until \\nclosure in 2014, following a 2013 Stipulation and Order issued by the California Department of \\nToxic Substances Control (DTSC) that ordered Exide to temporarily suspend facility operations \\n(Ref. 4, p.4; Ref. 5, p.42). Since 2013, DTSC has overseen numerous on -site and off -site \\ninvestigations, as well as the implantation of a 2016 Final Closure Plan (Ref. 64, p.5 -6). \\nIn October 2020, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued an order that allowed Exide Technologies, Inc. \\nto transfer it to an environmental response trust. The Vernon Environmental Response Trust \\n(VERT) was created to facilitate the continuation of the cleanup activ ities (Ref. 64, p.6). Since \\nOctober 2021, EPA and DTSC have overseen the actions of the VERT at the Exide -Vernon facility \\n(Ref. 64, p.5 -6). \\nHistorical activities conducted at the Exide -Vernon facility included battery breaking; secondary \\nsmelting; lead refining; storage, handling, and transportation of batteries and other materials \\nassociated with recycling operations; and chemical processing (Ref. 5, p.42). Air emissions from \\nstacks; inadequate maintenance and repair of the containment building; spills at the Exide -Vernon \\nfacility and spills from trucks transporting material to and from the facility; releases from a \\nstormwater containment and other liquid containments; and insufficient dust controls contributed \\nto the release and dispersion of lead -impacted airborne particulates (Ref. 5, p.42; Ref 6, p.5) \\nTCE contamination within the footprint of the old mixed -metals extrusion building, identified as \\nSolid Waste Management Unit No. 11 (SWMU -11) in the southern portion of the facility (referred \\nto as the “South Yard”), is elevated based on the HRS criteria (three times background) and \\nexceeds the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) allowed for public drinking water sources \\n(Figure A -2 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 7, p.3 0-32). \\nTCE was used as a cooling medium during the extrusion of metal bars and stock into various \\nshapes (Ref. 9, p.34). As documented in a 1986 Phase I Site Assessment and a 1990 RCRA Facility \\nAssessment (RFA), the TCE was stored in 20 -pound containers immediate ly south of SWMU -11 \\nand was taken from the storage area and poured into an open storage vat that fed the extrusion \\nprocess (Ref. 8, p.44; Ref. 65, p.16). It is unknown what happened to the excess TCE after the \\nextrusion process, however ongoing releases re portedly occurred throughout the lifespan of \\n18 Site Description     \\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n      \\n    \\n \\n \\n       \\n        \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n      \\n     \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n      \\n         \\n \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n     \\n     EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\noperations ( Ref. 8, p. 44; Ref. 9, p.34). It is unknown exactly when operations were started in this \\nlocation; however, the mixed -metal operations ceased in approximately 1978 (Ref. 8, p. 44; Ref. \\n9, p. 34 ). Based on facility conditions and environmental investigations conducted, it is believed \\nthat the contamination found beneath SWMU -11 likely originated from surface releases of TCE \\n(Ref. 8, p.6, 44; Ref. 9, p.34; Ref. 10, p.313 -316; Ref. 12, p.12 ). \\nA dissolved phase fraction entered the groundwater and began to slowly migrate south -southeast \\nwith the hydraulic gradient. Based on the geology underlying SWMU -11, it appears that upon \\nrelease, the TCE migrated vertically through approximately 75 feet of unsaturated sediments over \\ntime (Ref. 12, p.12). \\nSoil and soil vapor samples collected in the vicinity of SWMU -11 in 2005 and 2015 indicated \\nsignificantly elevated concentrations of TCE in soil to a depth of 70 feet bgs, and in soil vapor to \\na depth of 68 feet bgs (Ref. 9, p.92 , 113 -114; Ref. 12, p.35, 37 , 46). \\nOn July 1, 2022, the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) requested that the \\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) evaluate the former Exide facility and surrounding \\nareas potentially impacted by the former facility’s operations, as a candidate for the National \\nPriorities List (NPL) (Ref. 13, p.1 -2). \\nIn November 2022, EPA completed a Preliminary Assessment (PA) at the former Exide -Vernon \\nfacility. The primary objective of the PA was to evaluate existing information to be used in the \\nHRS characterization process, including source areas and levels of con tamination in surface soil.  \\nThe PA, which relied primarily on soil data collected by DTSC, concluded that the Exide – Vernon \\nfacility is a documented source of lead contamination and that historical operations at the facility \\nlikely contributed to the emi ssion and deposition of lead along with other heavy metals onto the \\nsoil and other surfaces around the facility and surrounding areas. (Ref. 4, p.4 -6, 19 -20). \\nA Site Inspection (SI) was initiated in January 2023 with the initial objective to augment DTSC \\ncollected soils and groundwater data, however, EPA determined that DTSC’s existing background \\ndata and residential sampling protocols needed to be amended to comport with HRS requirements \\n(Ref. 7, p p. 10, 18). This resulted in an extensive background soil collection effort, modifications \\nto DTSC -executed residential sampling beginning May 1, 2023, and supplemental groundwater \\nsampling in the south yard (Ref. 7, p.10). The data and documentation identified d uring the SI was \\ndetermined to be insufficient to meet the criteria for consideration under the HRS for the soil \\nexposure pathway (Ref. 7, p.52). However, b ased on the results of the SI, as well as historical on -\\nsite sampling results, an observed release of TCE to groundwater within the Exposition through \\nJefferson hydrologic unit was established (Ref. 7, p.47). TCE was detected in the groundwater \\nrelease sample collected from Exposition aquifer in 2021 at a concentration of 47 µg/L, which is \\nconsidered significantly above background based on the result of 15 µg/L collected from the \\nbackground well (Ref. 7, p. 47). This release is attributable, at l east in part, to the Exide -Vernon \\nfacility as a sample was collected immediately downgradient of an area of documented TCE soil \\ncontamination, which was a result of historical operations (Ref. 7, p.47). \\nThere are 52 known active drinking water wells within the 4 -mile Target Distance Limit (TDL) of \\nthe source. These wells, which are operated by 14 distinct water purveyors, serve an estimated \\n19 Site Description     \\n \\n \\n       \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\napportioned population of 306,890.50 (Ref. 34, p.1 -18; Figure A -6 of this HRS documentation \\nrecord). Of these 52 wells, 17 were identified as having at least some portion of their screening \\ninterval consistent with the depths of the Exposition through Jeff erson hydrologic unit, which \\nserves an estimated population of 133,7 46.29 (Ref. 33, p.1 -17). \\n20 Site Description     \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n            \\n      \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n \\n  EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\nSITE SOURCES \\nOne source was evaluated for scoring the Exide Technologies – Vernon facility (see Figure A-2 \\nof this HRS documentation record ).

SWMU -11 is located \\nwithin the footprint of the old mixed -metals extrusion building . As shown on historical Sanborn \\nMaps (Ref. 66, p.7), the old mixed -metals extrusion building was located immediately west of the \\ncurrent engineering building and had a size of approximately 10,000 ft2 (Ref.8, p.44). \\nTCE was used as a cooling medium during the extrusion of metal bars and stock into various \\nshapes (Ref. 9, p.34). As documented in a 1986 Phase I Site Assessment and a 1990 RCRA Facility \\nAssessment (RFA), the TCE was stored in 20 -pound containers immediate ly south of SWMU -11 \\nand was taken from the storage area and poured into an open storage vat that fed the extrusion \\nprocess (Ref. 8, p.44; Ref. 65, p.16). It is unknown what happened to the excess TCE after the \\nextrusion process, however ongoing releases re portedly occurred throughout the lifespan of \\noperations ( Ref. 8, p. 44; Ref. 9, p.34). It is unknown exactly when operations were started in this \\nlocation; however, the mixed -metal operations ceased in approximately 1978 (Ref. 8, p.44 ; Ref. 9, \\np. 34 ).\\nBased on facility conditions and environmental investigations conducted, it is believed that the \\ncontamination found beneath SWMU -11 likely originated from surface releases of TCE (Ref. 8, \\np.6, 44; Ref. 9, p.34; Ref. 10, p.313 -316; Ref. 11, p.85). Based on previous on -site soil vapor\\nmonitoring, the TCE likely volatilized into the soil gas. Soil and soil vapor samples collected in\\nthe vicinity of SWMU -11 in 2005 and 2015 indicated significantly elevated concentrations of TCE\\n(Ref. 10, p.313 -316). As part of the 2005 Phase 2 RFI conducted by Exide’s contractor, the TCE -\\nimpacted subsurface soil in the South Yard was assessed to determine the extent of subsurface\\ncontamination and potential vapor intrusion impacts (Ref. 9, p. 60, 80 -83). A subsequent\\ninvestigation of TCE impacted soil beneath SWMU -11 was conducted in 2015 under the\\nsupervision of DTSC (Ref. 10, p.313 -316).\\nBased on the geology underlying SWMU -11, the TCE appears to have migrated vertically through \\napproximately 75 feet of unsaturated sediments , where a dissolved phase fraction entered the \\ngroundwater and began slowly migrating south -southeast consistent with hydraulic gradient (Ref \\n12, p.12) . In addition, groundwater m onitoring wells were installed in 1986 and 1987 at the \\nlocation of the former storage vats where levels of TCE have been observed at an order of \\nmagnitude higher than the maximum concentrations measured in nearby monitoring wells (Ref. 7, \\np.31-32, Ref. 11, p.85 ).\\n22 Source 1 Characterization     \\n \\n \\n        \\n     \\n         \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n     \\n     \\n       \\n       \\n      \\n \\n \\n      \\n       \\n  \\n       \\n      \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n        \\n       \\n    \\n     \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n       \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\nThe full extent of contaminated soil at SWMU -11 (Source 1) could not be adequately determined, \\nhowever based on soil and soil vapor sampling conducted from 2005 through 2015, it is estimated \\nto cover a surface area of at least 14,950 ft2, with an approximate depth of at least 7 5 feet below \\nthe ground surface (ft bgs). (Ref. 9, p.92, 113 -114; Ref. 10, p.313 -316; Ref. 12, p. 35, 37, 46; see \\nFigure A -4 of this HRS documentation record ). \\n2.2.2 HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOURCE \\nOn-site soils at SWMU -11 (Source 1) are contaminated with TCE, which is likely a result of \\nhistorical on -site operations within the South Yard. As part of the 2005 Phase 2 RFI conducted \\nby Exide’s contractor, the TCE -impacted subsurface soil beneath SWMU -11 was assessed to \\ndetermine the extent of subsurface contamination and potential vapor intrusion impacts . A \\nsubsequent investigation of TCE impacted soil beneath SWMU -11 was conducted in 2015 under \\nthe supervision of DTSC ( Ref. 9, p.80 -83). \\nAs shown in the table below and Figure A -3 of this HRS documentation record, soil samples from \\nSWMU -11 were collected from 8 soil borings (two in 2005, one in 2014, and five in 2015) at \\ndepths ranging from 1 ft to 76 ft bgs (Ref.10, p.313 -316). The highest TCE soil result observed in \\nshallow soil was 990 micrograms per kilogram ( µg/kg ) at a depth of 1.5 feet ( Ref. 10, p. 149; Ref. \\n12, p.35). The highest TCE soil result observed in deeper soil was 150 µg/kg at a depth of 70 feet \\n(Ref.9, p. 92). \\nBased on the geology underlying SWMU -11, it appears that upon release, the TCE migrated \\nvertically through approximately 75 feet of unsaturated sediments over time ( Ref. 12, p. 42-43). \\nAs shown in the table below and Figure A -4 of this HRS documentation record , a total of 68 soil \\nvapor samples (including 4 duplicate samples) were collected from 27 temporary vapor probes (23 \\nprobes in 2005, four probes in 2015) at depths ranging from 0.5 ft to 68 ft bgs. The maximum \\ndocumented TCE soil vapor concentration observ ed in shallow soil was 220 μg/L at a depth of 5 \\nfeet ( Ref. 9, p. 108; Ref. 12, p. 36). The maximum documented TCE soil vapor result observed in \\ndeeper subsurface soil was 730 μg/L at a depth of 68 feet ( Ref. 12, p.3 7). The vapor data indicate \\nthat the concentration of vapor -phase TCE decreases with depth suggesting that the source was \\nsurficial in nature (Ref. 12, p.11) . \\nThe TCE contamination appears to have migrated to the groundwater beneath Source 1, as \\ndiscussed in Section 3.1 .1 of this HRS Documentation Record. \\n23 Source 1 Characterization    \\n   \\n     \\n   \\n            \\n           \\n       \\n            \\n           \\n        \\n          \\n          \\n           \\n          \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n           \\n           \\n             \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n             \\n            \\n            \\n            \\n          \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n    \\n           \\n          \\n          \\n   \\n   \\n         \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n             \\n   \\n       \\n   \\n EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\nSWMU -11 Soil Sampling Results \\nSample \\nLocation Depth \\n(ft bgs) Date TCE1 \\n(µg/kg) DL \\n(µg/kg) Reference \\nHSA -24 8.5 12/5/2005 2.5 1.6 Ref. 9, p. 92;

For this HRS consideration, hazardous substances \\nassociated with the observed release includes TCE, which has been detected at concentrations \\nsignificantly above background in monitoring wells immediately downgradient of SWMU -11 \\n(Source 1) where TCE was used as a cooling medium duri ng the metals extrusion process (Ref. 9, \\np.34).\\nTCE has consistently been detected above the MCLs in the perched zone beneath SWMU -11 since \\nthe 1980s and detected above the MCL in the Exposition aquifer since 2015, when monitoring \\nwells screened within the Exposition aquifer were installed (see Section s 2.2 and 3.1.1 of this HRS \\ndocument ation record ). \\nRegional Geology/Aquifer Description \\nThe Exide -Vernon facility lies within the Central Subbasin in the Coastal Plain of the Los Angeles \\nGroundwater Basin. The Central Subbasin is generally bound to the north by the folded, uplifted, \\nand eroded Tertiary basement rocks of the La Brea High surface divide; to the northeas t and east \\nby the less permeable Tertiary rocks of the Elysian, Repetto, Merced, and Puente Hills; to the \\nsoutheast by the Coyote Creek (approximate Los Angeles County/Orange County boundary); and \\nto the southwest by the Newport Inglewood Uplift, a regiona l anticline associated with the \\nNewport Inglewood fault system. (Ref. 27, p.118 -119, 168-169; Ref. 28, p.1 -2). \\nThe Central Subbasin has historically been divided into the Los Angeles Forebay at the northwest, \\nthe Montebello Forebay at the north, the Whittier Area at the northeast, and the Central Basin \\nPressure Area at the center and southwest. However, these areal distinctions are appropriate for \\ngeographical purposes only and do not accurately represent hydrogeologic conditions within the \\nareas. In actuality, the hydrogeologic forebays, which are generally characterized by unconfined \\nand relatively interconnected aquifer systems, are limited to only small regions within the greater \\nForebay areas (Ref. 27, p.168 -169, 193 -198). \\nThe Montebello Forebay, as well as the Los Angeles Forebay to a lesser degree, serves as the \\nprimary groundwater recharge areas for both shallow and deep aquifers across the entirety of the \\nsubbasin. The Central Basin Pressure Area is generally characteriz ed by confined aquifer systems \\nseparated by relatively impermeable clay layers, although semipermeable zones within these layers \\nallow aquifers to be interconnected in some areas. These semipermeable zones gradually decrease \\nin frequency and magnitude with increasing distance from the forebays ( Ref. 27, p. 168-169, 186 -\\n187, 193 -198; Ref. 28, p.1 -2). \\n32 Ground Water Migration Pathway     \\n \\n \\n       \\n   \\n \\n   \\n    \\n     \\n \\n       \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n      \\n     \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n \\n      \\n     \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n \\n     EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\nThroughout much of the subbasin, the Pleistocene -age aquifers are under confined conditions due \\nto the presence of fine -grained, low -permeability interbedded sediments. Although these fine \\ngrained sediments, or aquicludes, generally restrict the downward m igration of groundwater from \\noverlying aquifers, semipermeable zones within the aquicludes allow aquifers to be interconnected \\nin some areas (Ref. 27, p.168 -169). In addition, hydrogeologic modeling of multi -aquifer systems \\nsimilar to that found in the Cen tral Basin Pressure Area, has shown that groundwater wells \\nscreened across multiple aquifers (or wells with improperly constructed annular seals that cross \\nmultiple aquifers) can act as a direct pathway for the migration of significant volumes of shallow \\ngroundwater into deep confined aquifers when vertical hydraulic head variations create a \\ndownward hydraulic gradient. The process of this downward migration has increased in areas \\nwhere the deeper aquifers have periods of high -volume pumping such as seasona l demand. \\nFurthermore, additional studies have shown that liquids that are denser than water (i.e., dense non -\\naqueous phase liquids [DNAPLs] such as PCE and TCE) can migrate downward through a multi -\\naquifer well even when vertical hydraulic head variations create an upward hydraulic gradient \\n(Ref. 27, p. 168-169; Ref. 29, p.13 -17; Ref. 31, p. 1-4). \\nThe regional groundwater flow direction within the subbasin, which was calculated using data \\nfrom wells screened within the Upper San Pedro Formation (Lynwood through Silverado aquifers), \\nis generally to the southwest. Based upon data collected between 200 7 and 2022, flow within these \\ndeeper aquifers in the vicinity of the Exide -Vernon facility trended towards the southwest with \\ntemporal variations from west to south -southwest ( Ref. 32, p.21 -22, 69, 72 -86). \\nGeologic units typically found beneath the subbasin include : \\n•Holocene -age Alluvium : Recent alluvium is primarily stream deposited gravel, sand, silt\\nand clay with some interbedded littoral and estuary or bay deposits near the ocean.\\nGeologic members found within the alluvial deposits include the Semiperched aquifer,\\nBellflower aquiclude, Gaspur aquifer, and Ballona aquifer (Ref. 27, p p. 63-64).\\noSemiperched Aquifer : Includes c oarse sands and gravels found on or near the\\nsurface of much of the Coastal Plain of Los Angeles County , varying in thickness\\nfrom 0 to 60 feet and may contain significant amounts of unconfined water (Ref.\\n27, p.64 , 172 ).\\noBellflower Aquiclude : Directly beneath the Semiperched aquifer, with sediments of\\nlesser permeability that restrict some vertical movement of ground water, varying\\nin thickness from 0 to 200 feet , and has a maximum depth of 100 feet (Ref. 27,\\np.65-66, 172 ).\\noGaspur Aquifer : Water -bearing zone directly beneath the Bellflower aquiclude,\\nwhere the upper part is medium to coarse -textured sand while the lower part\\nconsists of sand, gravel, and cobbles as large as five inches in diameter, with a\\nthickness ranging up to about 120 feet, and a maximum depth of 160 feet (Ref. 27,\\np.66-67, 173 ).\\noBallona Aquifer : Water -bearing zone found in a relatively small area in the\\n33 Ground Water Migration Pathway     \\n \\n \\n         \\n     \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n     \\n \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n     \\n \\n       \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n      \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\nnorthwest section of the basin, composed of coarse sand, rounded to subrounded \\ngravel, and cobbles up to five inches in diameter that are of both granitic and \\nmetamorphic origin , varying in thickness from 10 to 40 feet (Ref. 27 , p.69 -70). \\n•Upper Pleistocene Lakewood Formation : Underlying the recent alluvium is the Lakewood\\nFormation, where the upper part includes rapid lithologic changes, with discontinuous\\npermeable zones and considerable variation in particle size, typical of stream alluviation\\nwith fine -grained sediments, and the lower part includes gravels and coarse sands, confined\\nto a nar row extension reaching the Newport -Inglewood uplift. The Lakewood formation\\nis divided into the contemporaneous Artesia and Exposition aquifers, the hydraulic\\ncontinu ous Gage and Gardena aquifers, and the unnamed aquicludes between the aquifers\\n(Ref. 27, p.74 -75).\\noArtesia Aquifer : Water -bearing zone of varying thickness, composed of coarse\\ngravel, coarse to fin e sand and interbedded silts and clays , generally below the\\nsouthern end of the Gaspur aquifer , and appears to be related to the San Gabriel\\nRiver, Coyote Creek, and Santa Ana River system (Ref. 27, p.75 -76, 280, 284).\\nStratigraphically, the Artesia aquifer is generally deeper than the Gaspur aquifer,\\nhowever some upper reaches abut directly with the Gaspur, and there are multiple\\nuplift locations where the Art esia aquifer is higher in elevation (Ref. 27, p.77).\\noExposition Aquifer: Water -bearing zone with a maximum thickness of 100 feet, and\\na maximum depth of 160 feet, consisting of sand and gravel members separated by\\ndiscontinuous lenses of silt and clay, generally below the northern end of the\\nGaspur aquifer , and appears to be related to the Los Angeles River drainage system\\n(Ref. 27, p.75, 77, 173, 280, 284). Stratigraphically, as with the Artesia aquifer, the\\nExposition aquifer is generally deeper than the Gaspur aquifer, while some upper\\nreaches abut directly with the Gaspur, with multiple uplift locations where the\\nExposition aquifer is higher in elevation (Ref. 27, p.77). Lower members of the\\nExposition extend beneath the Gaspur aquifer and merge laterally with the Artesia\\naquifer , and horizontally with the underlying Gage aquifer (Ref. 27, p.77).\\noGage Aquifer : Water -bearing zone as deep as 350 feet, with a maximum thickness\\nof 10 to 160 feet, comprised of fine to coarse sand with variable amounts of gravel,\\nsandy silt, and clay (Ref. 27, p.78). The Gage aquifer is hydraulically connected\\nwith contemporaneous Gardena aquifer, overlapping throughout the basin (Ref. 27,\\np.79). The combined Gage -Gardena aquifer merges with the shallower Exposition\\naquifer near the Montebello plain, and merges with the deeper Lynwood and\\nSunnyside aquifers in the western part of the basin (Ref. 27, p.77, 80 , 300, 304).\\noGardena Aquifer: Similar in thickness , elevation to maximum depth of 290 feet ,\\nand composition to those of the Gage aquifer , and hydraulically continuous with\\nthe Gage throughout much of its extent (Ref. 27, p.80, 82 , 174 ).

Based on the geology underlying SWMU -11, it appears that\\nupon release, the TCE migrated vertically through approximately 75 feet of unsaturated sediments\\nover time (Ref. 12, p.12).\\nAs discussed in Section 2.2.2 and shown on Figure A -5 of this HRS documentation record, two \\nmonitoring wells (PW -2 and MW -14) installed beneath SWMU -11 and one well immediately \\ndowngradient of SWMU -11 (MW -11) have been sampled since 1996. The maximum docum ented \\nTCE concentration of 5,500 µg/L was observed at PW -2 in August 2000 (Ref. 9, pp. 138, 141, \\n144). The maximum documented TCE concentration of 2,500 µg/L was observed at MW -14 in \\nMay 1999 ( Ref. 9, p. 141). The maximum documented TCE concentration of 2, 500 µg/L was \\nobserved at MW -11 in September 1999 ( Ref. 9, p. 138). \\nAn Exposition aquifer monitoring well (MW -11D) immediately downgradient of SWMU -11 has \\nbeen sampled since 2015, with a maximum TCE concentration of 200 μg/L observed in December \\n2015 ( Ref. 11, p. 146; Ref. 38, p. 35). An Exposition aquifer monitoring well (MW -12D) \\nimmediately upgradient of SWMU -11 has been sampled since 2015, with a maximum TCE \\nconcentration of 22 μg/L observed in was observed in March 2018 (Ref. 47, p. 43). \\nAs discussed above, on -site sampling results collected in September 2021 were used to establish \\nan observed release of TCE to the Exposition aquifer. TCE was reported in a duplicate sample \\nfrom MW -11D at a concentration of 47 µg/L, which is considered significantly above (three times) \\nbackground based on the result of 15 µg/L collected from well MW -12D during the same sampling \\nevent (Ref. 20, p. 41, 18; Ref. 25, p p. 14, 44, 46; Ref. 22, p. 47). \\nThe historical TCE concentration s at MW -11D have been consistently greater than concentrations \\nat immediately upgradient well MW -12D, indicat ing a localized on -site TCE source beneath \\nSWMU -11 impacting groundwater in the Exposition aquifer, separate from other on-site and off -\\nsite sources potentially contributing to the TCE levels found in on -site wells. At least 10 known \\ngroundwater monitoring wells are located immediately adjacent to the Site. These include nearby \\neight Exposition aquifer wells associated with the former Honeywell Bandi ni site (now Baker \\nCommodities) immediately east of the Exide Technologies – Vernon site , and two Exposition \\naquifer wells associated with the former Univar Solutions USA facility, located approximately \\n0.75 miles northeast of the Exide Technologies – Vernon site (Ref. 11, p.87 -89, 98 , 99; Ref 22 \\np.19, 66 ; Ref. 54, p.37; Ref. 55, p.35 ).\\n46 Ground Water Migration Pathway     \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n       \\n    \\n     \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n       \\n \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n     \\n  \\n       \\n     \\n    \\n   \\n \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n           EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON \\nFormer Honeywell Bandini Site (now Baker Commodities) \\n4037 Bandini Boulevard, Vernon, California \\nDTSC EnviroStor ID 19340780 \\nThe former Honeywell Bandini site (now Baker Commodities) is situated immediately east \\nof the Exide Technologies – Vernon facility and operated as a metals forming manufacturer \\nfrom 1951 to 2002.

H.  BAXTER  Eugene, Oregon  \\nLane  Count y \\n\\uf0feSite Location:\\nThe J. H. Baxter site is a former wood treating facility located at 3494 Roosevelt Blvd. in Eugene, Lane County, \\nOregon. The approximately 32-acre facility is adjacent to two drainages, Roosevelt Channel and an unnamed drainage \\nditch, and is located in a mixed residential, commercial, and industrial zoned portion of the city of Eugene. \\n\\uf0a1 Site History: \\nWood treating operations began \\nin 1943 and continued until the facility closure in January 2022. Due to violations of \\nair and water quality permits, as well as hazardous waste violations and complaints of intense odors, the site has been \\nunder investigation since 1989 by the EPA and state and local agencies. The facility is currently owned by J. H. Baxter \\n& Co.\\n\\uf090 Site Contamination/Contaminants:  \\nContamination is present in groundwater , sediments  and soils from historic operational practices and spills. Wood \\ntreating chemicals were also left in place in tanks, retorts , and other containers when facility operations halted in 2022. \\nSampling conducted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) and the EPA indicates that f acility and \\nnearby residential property soils are contaminated with dioxins, arsenic, dieldrin, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene  \\n(DDE ), benzo(a)pyrene, cadmium, and lead.  Sediments in Roosevelt Channel  and an unnamed ditch are contaminated \\nwith dioxins, arsenic, dieldrin, DDE, benzo(a)pyrene, and cadmium.  Soil samples collected from residential properties \\nidentified concentrations of dioxin s above the EPA Residential R egional Screening Levels (RSLs) at 15 of the 26 \\nproperties sampled.  Sediment samples collected downstream of the facility contained concentrations of metals above \\nthe respective Oregon DEQ  Risk-Based Concentration  up to three  miles downstream of the facility.  \\n\\uf094 Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment : \\nContamination in facility and residential property soils may pose a threat to remaining workers, trespassers, and \\nresidents that include children. Areas of soil contamination at residential properties include areas used by residents for \\nrecreation, lawn and house maintenance, and gardening. Additionally, there is evidence of sediment contamination \\nin Roosevelt Channel and an unnamed drainage ditch which pose potential risks to human health and downstream \\nfisheries and wetlands. Fishing in the area including Roosevelt Channel is known to occur and consumption of fish \\nmay pose a risk to human health. Contaminated groundwater also presents concerns to the environment.\\n\\uf050 Response Activities (to date) : \\nAs of May 2024, Oregon DEQ conducted  soil cleanup activities at seven nearby residential properties. The EPA \\ninitiated a time critical removal action in early August 2024 to remove bulk chemicals from tanks and piping.\\n\\uf09b Need for NPL Listing: \\nThe state of Oregon referred the site to the EPA because of the contamination present at the J. H. Baxter wood-treatment \\nfacility. Other federal and state cleanup programs were evaluated, but no other program has the appropriate authorities  \\nor resources to address the site at this time. The EPA received a letter of support for placing this site on the NPL from \\nthe state of Oregon. \\n[The description of the site (release) is based on information available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS. The description may \\nchange as additional information is gathered on the sources and extent of contamination. See 56 FR 5600, February 11, 1991, or subsequent \\nFR notices.] \\nFor more information about the hazardous substances identified in this narrative summary, including general information regarding the effects of exposure to \\nthese substances on human health, please see the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) ToxFAQs.

H. Baxter is a former wood -processing and treatment facility located at 3494 Roosevelt \\nBoulevard , formerly 85 Baxter Street, in southwest Eugene, Lane County, Oregon (Figure 1 and \\nFigure 2 of this HRS documentation record ; Ref. 5, p. 10; Ref. 18, p. 6 ). For HRS scoring purposes, \\nthe Site consists of the release of hazardous substances from wood -processing operations to two \\nareas of observed contamination (AOCs) . \\nHazardous substances associated with the AOCs include dibenzo -p-dioxin (dioxin ) and \\ndibenzofuran ( furan ) congeners, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenols, including \\npentachlorophenol (PCP), and metals, including cadmium, lead, and zinc (see Section 5.1 of this \\nHRS documentation record, General Considerations ). Two AOCs are documented , AOC A is a \\nportion of the former facility property and AOC B is in the adjacent residential neighborhood \\nimmediately to the north , with approximately 109 residents within AOC B subject to Level I or \\nLevel II concentrations (see Section s 5.1 and 5.1. 1.3 of this HRS doc umentation record). \\nThe J. H. Baxter facility is bordered t o the north by Roosevelt Boulevard, Roosevelt Channel, and \\na residential neighborhood ( Figure s 2 and 3B of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 5, p. 10). \\nResidential properties are located immediately to the north of Roosevelt Boulevard and Roosevelt \\nChannel (Ref. 12, p. 34). The neighborhood north of the facility was developed in the 1950s (Ref \\n12, p. 17). The southern border of the facility is formed by the Union Pacific Railroad right -of-\\nway (Ref. 4, p. 10 ). Industrial businesses surround the facility, with a metal recycling facility on \\nthe eastern boundary and plating, aviation, and lumber mill facilities to the west (Ref. 4, p. 10; \\nRef. 5, p. 10 ; Ref. 16, p. 7 ; Ref. 93, pp. 1 -3). The J. H. Baxter facility has been as large as 42.45 \\nacres (Ref. 5, p. 10 ; Ref. 12, p. 17), but was reduced to 31.5 acres by 2019 (Ref. 6, p. 9). \\nFacility History \\nBefore construction of the J. H. Baxter facility in 1943, the property was undeveloped farmland \\n(Ref. 6, p. 10 ; Ref. 7 , p. 18 ; Ref. 12, p. 17 ; Ref. 14 , p. 11). Operations at the facility consisted of \\nwood treating in retorts using a variety of preservative chemicals, including cr eosotes, PCP, metal -\\nbased solutions, and fire retardants (Ref . 5, pp. 13-18; Ref. 10 , pp. 3-4; Ref. 14 , p. 5; Ref. 15, p. \\n17; Ref. 15, p. 57 ; Ref. 16, p. 9 ). After raw wood products were treated in the retorts, they were \\ntransported via tram to concrete drip pads where the treated wood was allowed to dry until no \\nfurther drippage occurred. Following drying on the drip pad, treated wood products were either \\nstored on one of several treated wood -storage areas on facility property, or transported elsewhere \\nby truck or rail (Ref. 7, p. 20 ; Ref. 15, p. 18 ). The facility began with one retort, ultimately \\nexpanding to five before the facility was “mothballed” in early 2022, ceasing wood -treatment \\noperations and only performing essential maintenance and environmental compliance (Ref. 5, p. \\n13; Ref. 8, p. 1 ). \\nHistorical records describe a burn pit, 40 square feet in area and 4 feet deep, in the southwest \\nportion of the facility that was used for the disposal of waste between 1945 and 1955. Oil sludge \\nwas added to the pit via 55 -gallon drums and a pipeline coming from the process area . The pit was \\nexcavated and filled in 1955, and a still -standing dry shed was constructed on the excavation \\nfootprint (Ref. 5, p. 19 ; Ref. 6, p. 11 ; Ref. 7, p. 18 ; Ref. 10, p. 4 ; Ref. 15, p. 16 ). There are no \\nknown records documentin g whether the excavated fill was removed from the property (Ref. 5, p. \\n19; Ref. 7, p. 18, Ref. 15, p. 16 ). Later records indicate that hazardous waste was stored at the \\nfacility in the main treatment area. A designated hazardous waste storage shed was constructed in \\nthat area in 1982 and still stands today (Ref. 5, p. 20 ; Ref. 12, p. 18 ; Ref. 16, p. 10). \\n20  \\n           \\n       \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n      \\n    \\n     \\n \\n       \\n  \\n \\n      \\n     \\n   \\n        \\n    \\n     \\n  \\n       \\n     \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n       The retorts were situated on pavement and diked (Ref. 5, p. 13; Ref. 6, p. 11; Ref. 7, p. 19; Ref. 12, \\np.19). However, approximately 80% of the rest of the facility is unpaved  (Ref. 6, p.  11; Ref. 7,\\np. 19; Ref. 12, p. 19). Before 1976, most of the stormwater runoff from the facility went into the\\nground, with some runoff going into drainage ditches to the north and south (Ref. 7, p. 20; Ref. 15,\\np.18). Subsequently,  most  of the surface  runoff  on the facility  was  routed  to and  stored  in a\\nretention pond in the southwest corner of the property, which, after some aeration and skimming,\\nwas transferred  to a drainage  ditch,  ultimately  connecting  to the A-3  drainage  channel  in the\\nAmazon Creek watershed (Ref. 5, p. 22). A stormwater treatment system began operations in 1997\\n(Ref. 15, p. 30; Ref. 18, p. 12). The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) and J.\\nH.Baxter  entered  into a consent  order  in 1989 after  groundwater  contamination  from  facility\\noperations  was found (Ref.  10, p. 6).  A groundwater  treatment  system  was  installed  in 1993 to\\nextract  and remove contaminants,  preventing  continuing  migration  of contaminated water  off of\\nthe facility (Ref. 15, p. 29).\\nSince 1981,  the J.  H. Baxter  facility  has been  subject  to numerous  regulatory  investigations  and \\nactions during its operation and after its closure (Ref. 5, p. 26; Ref. 6, pp. 13-14; Ref. 7, pp. 27-28, \\n37-39; Ref. 15, op. 21, 24; Ref. 16, p. 12). In 2007, a 10-acre interim remedial action measure soil\\ncap was installed  throughout  the eastern  third  of the property,  to mitigate  airborne  transport  of\\ncontaminated soil away from the facility (Ref. 6, p. 11; Ref. 7 pp. 19, 44; Ref. 15, p. 32; Ref. 18,\\npp. 6, 11).  Since  1977, when  the first  air quality  complaint  was recorded,  residents  of the\\nneighborhoods to the north and northeast of the facility reported numerous complaints to the Lane\\nRegional Air Protection Agency (LRAPA) concerning odor and symptoms of illness (Ref. 59, p.\\n14; Ref. 88, p. 5, 7, 10) . The number of air quality complaints peaked in 2004, w ith 762 complaints\\nrecorded (Ref. 88, p. 7).\\nA notice  of violation  (NOV)  was  issued  to J. H. Baxter  in 2017 by EPA,  after an investigation \\nfound Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) violations at the facility (Ref. 13). These \\nviolations included lack of curbs or berms surrounding the retorts; failure to minimize tracking of \\nproduct off of the drip pad; failure to hold wood on the drip pad until drippage is complete; failure \\nto conduct  weekly  inspections  of the drip pad;  failure  to properly  label  containers;  disposal  of \\nhazardous  waste  without  a permit;  failure  to comply  with land disposal  restriction  treatment \\nstandards; and treatment and storage of hazardous wastes without a permit (Ref. 13, pp. 1-5). The \\n2017 NOV indicates  that J. H. Baxter  is a significant  non-complier  (Ref. 13,  p. 6). In  2020 and \\n2021, a consultant hired by J. H. Baxter collected soil samples near the facility and in residential \\nproperties.  Results  identified  elevated  levels  of dioxins  above  ODEQ  residential  soil risk-based \\nconcentration (4.7 parts per trillion [ppt]) in six residential yards out of seven sampled, with three \\nyards exceeding 40 ppt of dioxins (Ref. 17, pp. 1-2). \\nIn 2019, DEQ issue d a Rec ord of Decisi on (ROD ) that require d clea nup a t the facilit y as well as \\noff-facilit y soil sampl ing. I n Janua ry 2022, ODE Q issue d the facilit y a sc ope of wor k including \\nthe residentia l soil reme dial eleme nts prescribe d by the 2019 ROD . A wee k later, the company \\npresident indica ted that the facilit y would not be a ble to comple te the require d actions due to \\nfinanc ial limitations . The state was notifie d by the c ompany pre sident of their decisio n to \\n‘mothball ’ the facilit y, suspe nding all wood treat ment operati ons, while maintaining a skeleton \\ncrew to overse e the groundwater , stormwater , and proce ss wa ter treatme nt syste ms (Re f. 17, p. 2). \\nODEQ issue d a subseque nt Orpha n Site declaratio n for J. H. Baxte r & C o., making the company \\neligible for remediation funding through the state and federal government (Ref. 17, pp. 1-2) . \\nODEQ has completed soil removals at seven residential properties located to the north of the \\nfacility. The properties with removals were not included in population counts or hazardous waste\\nquantity values for AOC B (Ref. 41, pp. 10, 30; section 5.1.0 AOC B of this HRS documentation \\nrecord). \\n21  \\n       \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n       \\n  \\n    \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n          \\n        \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n         \\n \\n  \\n \\n       \\n     \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n      4.0 SURFACE WATER MIGRATION PATHWAY \\nThe Surface Water Migration Pathway was not scored, as its inclusion does not affect the listing \\ndecision. The Surface Water Migration Pathway is, however, a concern to EPA. \\nThe J. H. Baxter facility is located within the Amazon Creek watershed. The Amazon Creek \\nwatershed has been modified extensively over the years through a series of manmade ditches and \\nchannels (Ref. 4, p. 62 -63; Ref. 5, pp. 21 -22). Stormwater treatment system and groundwater \\ntreatment system outflow from the J. H. Baxter facility discharge to Roosevelt Channel a nd its \\ntributaries, located adjacent to the north of the facility (Ref. 4, pp. 60 -61). Roosevelt Channel flows \\nto the A3 channel, approximately 1 mile downstream of the facility. The A3 channel flows 1.24 \\nmiles to Amazon Creek. From Amazon Creek, it is a f urther 12.32 miles to the confluence with \\nClear Lake, and an additional 1.05 miles to the confluence with the Long Tom River. An additional \\ndiversion channel exists on Amazon Creek, 330 feet south of the A3 channel confluence. During \\na high water event, it is possible that surface water entering Amazon Creek from the A3 channel \\nmay backflow into the diversion channel. The Amazon Creek diversion channel flows for 3.81 \\nmiles until it reaches the Fern Ridge Reservoir, which continues for 3.4 miles to the confl uence \\nwith the Long Tom River (Ref. 4, p. 62 -63). \\nFrom 1955 to 1981, the annual mean flow rate for Amazon Creek ranged from 17.4 cubic feet per \\nsecond (cfs) to 54 cfs. More recent gaging data was not available (Ref. 81). USGS gaging data was \\nnot available for Roosevelt Channel A3 Channel, and Amazon Creek Diversion Channel. From \\n2014 to 2024, annual mean flow rate to Long Tom River at the outfall from Fern Ridge Lake \\nranged from 299.4 cfs to 751.9 cfs (Ref. 80). \\n2023 EPA IA Sampling \\nEPA tasked Weston , under START Contract No. 68HE0720D005 and TO 68HE0722F0059, to \\nconduct an IA at the J. H. Baxter site (Ref. 4, p. 9). Sampling was conducted under an \\nEPA -approved site -specific SAP (Ref. 4, p. 19; Ref. 9). As part of the IA, sediment samples were \\ncollected in May 2023. Sediment samples were collected from Amazon Creek and its unnamed \\ntributaries, Roosevelt Channel, South Channel, and Amazon Creek Diversion Channel (Ref. 4, pp. \\n20, 44). Samples were submitted for off -site fixed laboratory analysis for TAL VOCs, TAL \\nSVOCs, TAL Pesticides, TAL Aroclors, and TAL Inorganics, using CLP SOW SFAM01.1 \\nmethodology for all analyses (Ref. 4, p. 19 -20, 25). Some predetermined locations were also \\nanalyzed for dioxins and furans using CLP SOW HRSM02.1, Total Organic Carbon using PSEP -\\nTOC -M, and grain size (Ref. 4, pp. 20, 25). Dioxin/furan congeners and metals were detected in \\nsediments collected from downstrea m of the J. H. Baxter facility (Ref. 4, pp. 82 -84, 571 -585). \\nSurface Water Targets \\nNo drinking water intakes are located within 15 miles downstream of the J. H. Baxter facility (Ref. \\n4, p. 63). During the 2023 IA sampling event, a resident informed EPA that crawfish caught in \\nAmazon Creek had been fished and consumed “regularly” during the summer months (Ref. 4, p. \\n399). Online message boards also indicate that fishing occurs in Amazon Creek, Amazon Creek \\nDiversion Channel, Fern Ridge Reservoir, and Clear Lake. Rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ), \\nlargemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ), bluegill ( Lepomis macrochirus ), crappie ( Pomoxis sp. ), \\ncommon carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) and yellow bullhead ( Ameiurus natalis ) are species reportedly \\n22 SWOF  \\n       \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n \\n caught from these water bodies (Ref. 52, pp. 2 -4; Ref. 53, pp. 1 -2; Ref. 54, pp. 1 -2, 8-16; Ref. 84, \\npp. 1 -2, 7-17). \\nWetlands are located along Roosevelt Channel, A3 Channel, Amazon Creek, and Amazon Creek \\nDiversion Channel within 15 miles downstream of the J. H. Baxter facility (Ref. 4, p. 64 ; Ref. 56 ). \\nLong Tom River provides h abitat known to be used by the Federal -listed threatened Upper \\nWillamette River Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus \\ntshawytscha ) (Ref. 4, p. 64). \\n23 SWOF    \\n \\n       \\n \\n   \\n \\n         \\n  \\n \\n     \\n    \\n       \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n  5.0 SOIL EXPOSURE AND SUBSURFACE INTRUSION PATHWAY \\n5.1 SOIL EXPOSURE COMPONENT \\nTwo areas of observed contamination (AOCs) attributable to the J. H. Baxter site were evaluated for \\nscoring . Descriptions of the individual areas, with reference citations, are provided in the sections below. \\nAOC A is the Facility Contaminated Soil, measuring approximately 714,744 square feet on the facility. \\nAOC B is the Residential Contaminated Soil, measuring approximately 454,604 square feet within the \\nneighborhood to the north of the facility . Hazardous substances associated with these AOCs include dioxin \\nand furan congeners, metals, pesticides, and SVOCs. Detailed information about hazardous substances \\nand hazardous waste quantities in each source, with reference citations, is available in Section 5.1.0 of \\nthis HRS documentation record . \\nApproximately 109 residents occupy residential properties within AOC B (Tables 21 and 22 of this HRS \\ndocumentation record) . \\nTable 1 J.

H. Baxter facility property (Tables 2 through 4 and \\nFigure 3A of this HRS documentation record). Soil contamination was a result of historical operations as \\na wood -treatment facility . Operations at the facility included high -pressure wood treating in retorts using \\na variety of preservative chemicals, including PCP, ACZA, 50/50 Heavy Oil Blends of Creosote and \\nBunker C Oil (50/50), Creosote, and Alkaline Copper Quaternary -Type B (ACQ) (Ref. 5, pp. 13 -18; Ref. \\n10, pp. 3 -4; Ref. 14, p. 5; Ref. 15, pp. 17, 57; Ref. 16, p. 9; Ref. 87, pp. 9 ). After raw wood products were \\ntreated in the retorts, they were transported via tram to concrete drip pads where the treated wood was \\nallowed to dry until no further drippage occurred. After drying on the drip pad, treated wood products \\nwere either stored o n one of several on -property treated wood -storage areas or transported off -property by \\ntruck or rail (Ref. 7, pp. 20, 40; Ref. 15, p. 18 ; Ref. 87, p. 11 ). \\nIn 2017, EPA issued J.H. Baxter & Co. a NOV detailing eight RCRA violations found during an inspection \\nin 2014. Several of the violations were related to hazardous materials interacting with soil due to \\ninadequate drip pad infrastructure and maintenance associated with the retorts, which are located within \\nAOC A . The EPA inspector observed several such instances, noting that “ [i]n some areas, the oily \\nsubstance, waste wood preservative (EPA hazardous wastes numbers F032 and F034) , had stained and \\nsoaked into the soil, a nd in other areas the hazardous waste (waste wood preservative) was pooled on the \\nsoil surface.” In two other instances, the inspector noted PCP leakage from a pump hose and a pipe \\nconnected to a PCP storage tank. The releases were deemed “disposals,” and the facility was cited for \\ndisposal of hazardous waste without a permit and for failure to comply with Land Disposal Restrictions \\ntreatment standards. Based on the severity of these violations, the NOV classified the J. H. Baxter facility \\nas a “significant non-complier” (Figure 2 and Figure 3A of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 13, pp. \\n1-6).\\nBased on the soil sampling described below , AOC A was measured based on samples with concentrations \\nsignificantly above background. AOC A measures approximately 714,744 square feet (see Figure 3A of \\nthis HRS documentation record). \\nAOC A is documented below based on the 2023 EPA IA soil sampling event. Contaminated samples are \\ncompared to background samples collected during the same sampling event using the same field and \\nanalytical methods (Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 4, pp. 17 -18). \\nBackground locations are shown on Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record. Contaminated samples \\nused to document AOC A are shown on Figure 3A of his HRS documentation record. Grab surface soil \\nsampling for the IA was conducted by START on the J. H. Baxter facility and on residential properties in \\n2023 (Ref. 4, pp. 17, 19) . \\n25 \\nSE-Resident Population Threat    \\n \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n       \\n       \\n    \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n    \\n       \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n       \\n     \\n \\n \\n  EPA IA 2023 Site Assessment Surface Soil Samples \\nEPA tasked Weston Solutions, Inc. (Weston), under START Contract Number (No.) 68HE0720D005 and \\nTask Order (TO) 68HE0722F0059, to conduct an IA of the J. H. Baxter site (Ref. 4, p. 9). Sampling was \\nconducted under an EPA -approved site -specific Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) (Ref. 4, p. 19; Ref. \\n9). AOC A sampling was conducted in May 2023 (Ref. 4, pp. 17, 19). \\nSample locations are presented on Figure 3A and Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record. In May \\n2023, twelve surface soil field samples were collected at the J. H. Baxter facility from 0 to 6 inches bgs. \\nTwo background soil samples were collected for comparison to the contaminated soils (Ref. 4, p. 20). \\nBackground locations included two public parks in Eugene, Oregon, located ¾ -mile northwest and 2 ¼ -\\nmiles south o f the facility (Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 4, p. 19). Samples were \\ncolle cted as grab samples from 0 to 6 inches bgs using a non -dedicated hand auger, which was \\ndecontaminated after each use (Ref. 4, p. 17 -18). \\nSamples were submitted for off -site fixed laboratory analysis for TAL VOCs (SFAM01.1), TAL SVOCs \\n(SFAM01.1), TAL Pesticides (SFAM01.1), TAL Aroclors (SFAM 01.1), TAL Inorganics (SFAM 01.1), \\nand dioxins/furans (HRSM02.1). All samples were analyzed under EPA CLP Statement of Work (SOW) \\nSFAM01.1, with the exceptions of dioxins and furans which were analyzed under CLP SOW HRSM02.1 \\n(Ref. 4, pp. 19 -21, 25 -26). All sample analyses were validated following EPA’s Stage 4 Data Validation \\nElectronic/Manual Process. A START chemist performed a Stage 1 verification of each CLP data package. \\n(Ref. 4, p. 26). \\n-Background Surface Soil\\nDuring the IA, background surface soils were collected from two locations not expected to be affected by\\nhistorical site operations.

H. Baxter facility \\n(Figure 3B of this HRS documentation record). Soil contamination was a result of historical operations of \\nJ. H. Baxter as a wood -treatment facility. Operations at the facility included high -pressure wood treating \\nin retorts using a variety of preservative chemicals, including PCP, ACZA, 50/50 Heavy Oil Blends of \\nCreosote and Bunker C Oil (50/50), Creosote, and ACQ (Ref. 5, pp. 13 -18; Ref. 10, pp. 3 -4; Ref. 14, p. 5; \\nRef. 15, pp. 17, 57; Ref. 16, p. 9; Ref. 87, pp. 9 ). After raw wood produ cts were treated in the retorts, they \\nwere transported via tram to concrete drip pads where the treated wood was allowed to dry until no further \\ndrippage occurred. After drying on the drip pad, treated wood products were either stored on one of several \\non-property treated wood -storage areas or transported off -property by truck or rail (Ref. 7, pp. 20, 40; Ref. \\n15, p. 18; Ref. 87, p. 11). \\nSeasonal downwind direction from the facility is northward toward the residential neighborhood (Ref. 39, \\np.33; Ref. 59, pp. 3, 14, 16, 35; Ref. 92, p. 1). In 2007 , LRAPA completed an air sampling study in\\nresponse to community concerns regarding emissions from J. H. Baxter. The study was designed to\\nmeasure maximum downwind exposures in the neighborhoods nearest to the J. H. Baxter facility adjacent\\nto the north, northeast and northwest. The process at the J. H. Baxter facility that generated the majority\\nof the off-property emissions used mixtures of creosote, oil and PCP to treat wood products for\\npreservation. The various stages of treatment operations were performed in drying kilns and large retorts\\nusing pressure and vacuum. Emissions occurred from many points, including vacuum pumps, tank vents,\\nretort door openings, and treated product storage (Ref. 59, pp. 1, 3).\\nDetections of hazardous substances related to plant processes correlated well with downwind exposure. \\nNone of the facility -related hazardous substances were ever detected in samples that had no downwind \\nexposure (Ref. 59, pp. 6, 9). LRAPA staff documented operations -related odors on the facility and in the \\nneighborhood to the north during many of the air sampling events as part of the 2005 -2006 study. Resident \\ncomplaints were received during these times and confirmed by LRAPA staff (Ref. 59, pp. 25 -27, 29 -34). \\nBased on the soil sampling described below , AOC B was measured based on samples with concentrations \\nsignificantly above background. The area of contaminated soil measures approximately 454,604 square \\nfeet (see Figure 3B of this HRS documentation record). \\n38\\nSE-Resident Population Threat    \\n \\n        \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n \\n   \\n         \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  AOC B is documented below based on four soil sampling events conducted by J. H. Baxter, ODEQ, and \\nEPA in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Contaminated samples are compared to background samples collected \\nduring the same sampling events using the same field and analyt ical methods. Background locations are \\nshown on Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record. Contaminated samples used to document AOC B \\nare shown on Figure 3B of this HRS documentation record. ISM soil sampling was conducted at \\nresidential properties by J. H. Baxter and ODEQ in 2021 and 2022 (Ref. 39, p. 7; Ref. 92, pp. 1 -2; Ref. \\n118, pp. 9, 11 -12, 14) . As part of the EPA IA, ISM soil sampling was conducted by the EPA START on \\nresidential properties in 2022 (Ref. 4, p. 17) . ISM soil sampling was conducted by START at additional \\nresidential properties in 2023 (Ref. 4, p. 17) . Grab surface soil sampling for the IA was conducted by \\nSTART on the J. H. Baxter facility and on residential properties in 2023 (Ref. 4, p p. 9, 17, 19 ). \\nJ. H. Baxter and ODEQ 2021 -2022 ISM Surface Soil Sampling \\nIn 2021, J. H. Baxter conducted characterization of dioxin and furan concentrations in surface soils at \\neight properties suspected to be affected by air emissions deposition from the J. H. Baxter facility (Ref. \\n39, p. 7; Ref. 92, pp. 1 -2; Ref. 118, pp. 9, 11-12, 14). Elevated dioxin and furan concentrations were \\nidentified in soil samples collected from residential yards immediately north of the facility (Ref. 118, p. \\n12). Concentrations were highest in yards within areas where air deposition modeling compl eted by \\nLRAPA predicted predominant summer wind direction and deposition areas from the facility (Ref. 92, pp. \\n1-2; Ref. 118, p. 12).\\nIn January 2022, J. H. Baxter notified ODEQ it would not be able to implement cleanup at the residential \\nyards in a timely manner, and suspended wood treatment activities at its facility. ODEQ subsequently \\ndeclared the facility an Orphan Site to enable uti lization of the Industrial Orphan Site Account to complete \\nRemoval Assessments at the residential yards (Ref. 118, pp. 9, 12). In June 2022, ODEQ implemented \\ninvestigation of five additional residential properties (Ref. 118, pp. 1, 9, 13). \\nSamples were collected in background and residential DUs using ISM (Ref. 4, pp. 79 -81; Ref. 39, pp. 9 -\\n10; Ref. 117; Ref. 118, pp. 11 -13, 15 -17, 22). ISM samples were analyzed for metals, PAHs/PCP, and/or \\ndioxins/furans (Ref. 39. pp. 10, 15 -16, 33-34; Ref. 118, pp. 11 -13, 22).

Background locations included two public parks in \\nEugene, Oregon, located ¾ -mile northwest and 2 ¼ -miles south of the facility (Figure 4 of this HRS \\ndocu mentation record; Ref. 4, p. 19). Samples were collected as grab samples from 0 to 6 inches bgs using \\na non -dedicated hand auger, which was decontaminated after each use (Ref. 4, p. 17 -18). \\nSamples were submitted for off -site fixed laboratory analysis for TAL VOCs (SFAM01.1), TAL SVOCs \\n(SFAM01.1), TAL Pesticides (SFAM01.1), TAL Aroclors (SFAM 01.1), TAL Inorganics (SFAM 01.1), \\nand dioxins/furans (HRSM02.1).

The scope of the RSE \\nincluded collecting soil samples from residential pro perties in the neighborhood north of the facility, \\nanalyzing those samples, then reporting the results to EPA and ODEQ. EPA worked with ODEQ to \\nidentify the properties to evaluate. After agreeing on the initial 30 properties, EPA and START conducted \\nRSE fi eld activities from May 23, 2022, through May 27, 2022 (Ref. 4, p. 17). \\nSTART collected samples following the ISM. START collected increments of soil to a depth of six inches \\nbelow ground surface (bgs) and from 30 -75 increments within each Decision Unit (DU). The exact number \\nof increments was determined by the EPA on site. Fo r the May 2022 sampling, each property was divided \\ninto DUs based upon features of the property, and each sample was identified as either a Front Yard, \\nBackyard, Side Yard, or Garden Area. Soil samples were collected from each of these DUs and submitted \\nto the laboratory for analysis (Ref. 4, p. 17). During the May 2022 sampling effort, an ISM Whole Yard \\nsample was collected from 0 -6 inch es bgs. Additionally, one 5 -point composite sample was collected from \\neach DU from 0 -3 inches bgs (Ref. 4, p. 18). \\nAt the end of the project, samples were shipped to an analytical laboratory for ISM processing and \\nchemical analysis (Ref. 4, p. 18). The subcontracted analytical laboratory dried, sieved, and processed \\neach sample according to ISM. After processing, the s amples were analyzed for dioxins and furans using \\nEPA Method 1613B (Ref. 4, p. 18). \\n-2022 Background Surface Soil\\nBackground location JHB -33-WY was collected from Residence ID 52 (Ref. 51; Figure 4 of this HRS\\ndocumentation record). This location was selected to represent background concentrations for the 2022\\nISM sampling as it was the residence located furthest to t he east and was not directly north of the facility,\\nso was less likely to have received airborne contaminated soil or emissions from the J. H.

EPA and START conducted another round of residential soil \\nsampling from March 6, 2023 , through March 16, 2023, which included evaluation of an additional 22 \\nproperties (Ref. 4, p. 17). \\nSTART collected samples following the ISM. START collected increments of soil to a depth of six inches \\nbgs and from 30 -75 increments within each DU. The exact number of increments was determined by the \\nEPA on site. During the 2023 sampling effort, each pro perty was broken up into two DUs, called Front \\nYard and Backyard, and a 0 -6-inch bgs ISM sample was collected from each of those DUs. The difference \\nin approach for ISM samples was directed by EPA and ODEQ. Soil samples were collected from each of \\nthese DU s and submitted to the laboratory for analysis (Ref. 4, p. 17). Additionally, one 5 -point composite \\nsample was collected from each DU from 0 -3 inches bgs (Ref. 4, p. 18). Sample locations are shown on \\nFigure 3B and Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record. \\n53\\nSE-Resident Population Threat    \\n \\n      \\n         \\n      \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n       \\n       \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n       \\n       \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n       \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n       \\n       \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n       \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n   Each increment within a DU was composited into a sample bag. Upon completion of the ISM sample, the \\n5-point composite sample was collected and placed into a separate bag. Once all samples were collected\\nfrom a property, the samples were returned to the com mand post for sample processing and placed in a\\nsample cooler. At the end of the project, samples were shipped to an off -site analytical laboratory for ISM\\nprocessing and chemical analysis (Ref. 4, p. 18). The subcontracted analytical laboratory dried, sie ved,\\nand processed each sample according to ISM. After processing, the samples were analyzed for dioxins\\nand furans using EPA Method 1613B (Ref. 4, p. 18).\\n-2023 Background Surface Soil\\nBackground samples JHB -02-FY, JHB -57-FY, JHB -57-BY, JHB -59-BY, and JHB -59-FY were collected\\nfrom Residence IDs 53, 55, and 54, respectively ( Ref. 4, pp. 30, 32; Ref. 51; Figure 4 of this HRS\\ndocumentation record).

that is, the total mass, or a partial estimate, of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from the source is not known and cannot be estimated with reasonable confidence (Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.2). Insufficient historical and current data (permits, waste concentration data, annual reports, etc.) are available to adequately calculate the total mass, or a partial estimate, of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and the associated releases from the source. Therefore, there is insufficient information to adequately calculate or extrapolate a total or partial Hazardous Wastestream Quantity for AOC B with reasonable confidence.

However, the area of AOC B is not considered to be adequately determined as an undetermined portion of AOC B is beneath buildings, roads, or other impervious covers and seven properties within the AOC boundaries have undergone removal actions (Figure 3B of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 41, pp. 10, 30).

H. Baxter Facility \\nFacility Operations and Emissions \\nJ. H. Baxter operated as a wood -treatment facility from 1943 through 2022 (Ref. 6, p. 10; Ref. 7, p. 18; \\nRef. 8, p. 1; Ref. 12, p. 17; Ref. 14, p. 11). Operations at the facility included high -pressure wood treating \\nin retorts using a variety of preservative chemicals, including PCP, ACZA, 50/50 Heavy Oil Blends of \\nCreosote and Bunker C Oil (50/50), Creosote, and ACQ (Ref. 5, pp. 13 -18; Ref. 10, pp. 3 -4; Ref. 14, p. 5; \\nRef. 15, pp. 17, 57; Ref. 16, p. 9; Ref. 87, p. 9 ). After raw wood products were treated in retorts, they were \\ntransported to concrete drip pads where the treated wood was allowed to dry until no further drippage \\noccurred. After drying on the drip pad, treated wood products were either stored on one of several on -site \\ntreated wood -storage areas, or transported off -site by truck or rail (Ref. 7, pp. 20, 40; Ref. 15, p. 18; Ref. \\n87, p. 11). \\nVapors generated during the wood -treating process were routed to a condenser to remove liquid from the \\nexhaust stream. Liquids removed by the condenser were routed to a hot well prior to flowing to a \\ndownstream collection sump. Process liquids collected in the sump were delivered to a recovery tank prior \\nto entering the process water treatment system. The dried exhaust stream was routed to a knock -out drum \\nprior to exhausting to atmosphere through the PCP stack. The dried exhaust stream during heavy oil \\ncharges were routed to a downstream air pollution control device for control of VOC emissions prior to \\nemitting to atmosphere (Ref. 87, p. 10). \\nPoor housekeeping, including pipe leakage, soil staining, pooling of hazardous waste on the soil surface, \\nand failure to abide by odor abatement requirements have been noted during facility operations (Ref. 13, \\npp. 1 -6; Ref. 90, pp. 4 -5; Ref. 91, pp. 14 -15, 19, 23 -24, 26 -27). In 2014, an inspection was conducted at \\nthe J. H. Baxter facility using Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) technology and a Photoionization \\nDetector (PID) to identify process gas releases. Gas releases were identified at multiple location s including \\nthe oil -water separators, cooling tower basin, process water clarifier and vault, creosote and PCP sumps, \\nACZA scrubber vent, condensate unit, retorts, and treated wood (Ref. 91, pp. 1 -2, 3-5, 31 -57). \\nIn 2021, J. H. Baxter collected multiple raw material and process water samples from the facility for \\nanalysis of dioxins and furans, PAHs, VOCs, ammonia, wood organics, and/or total metals (Ref. 85, p. 1; \\nRef. 87 , pp. 1 -2, 13 -15, 21, 24 -25). As shown in Table 17 of this HRS documentation record below, \\nhazardous substances associated with AOC A and AOC B, including PCP, dioxins, furans, and PAHs, \\nwere detected in raw material and process water samples from the facility (Ref. 85, pp. 4 -7). \\nThe hazardous substances found at observed contamination concentrations in AOCs A and B include \\nPAHs, PCP, dioxins, furans, and metals (see Tables 2 through 16 of this HRS documentation record). \\nThere are three types of contaminants generally found at wood treater facilities, either alone or in \\ncombination: creosote, PCP, and chromated copper arsenate (CCA). Creosote is an oily liquid made up of \\napproximately 85% PAHs (Ref. 11, p. 23; Ref. 19, p. 165). In the wood preserving industry, creosote \\nsignifies a d istillate of coal tar produced by the high temperature carbonization of bituminous coal. Coal \\ntar creosote refers to “the fractions or blends of fractions specifically used for timber preservation” (Ref. \\n19, p. 165). The PAHs commonly found at wood treater sites include anthracene, benzo(a)anthracene, \\nbenzo(a)pyrene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, fluoranthene, indeno(1,2,3 -cd)pyrene, PCP, \\nphenanthrene, and pyrene (Ref. 11, p. 23; Ref. 19, pp. 166, 169 -171, 184). PCP was first used in the U.S. \\nin 1936 as a wood preservative to prevent fungal decay and insect damage.

Metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, and \\nlead, are associated with CCA or are otherwise commonly found at wo od treater sites (Ref. 11, p. 23). \\nPesticides may also be used in wood treatment to prevent rotting, insect damage, and mold (Ref. 23, p. 1). \\nThe presence of the PAH benzo(g,h,i)perylene and the phthalate bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (aka di(2 -\\nethylhexyl) p hthalate) at the site may be associated with the use of pesticides during the wood treating \\nprocess (Ref. 43, p. 2; Ref. 47, p. 1). \\nJ.

The number of air quality complaints peaked i n 2004, with \\n762 complaints recorded (Ref. 88, p. 7; Ref. 90, pp. 11 -12). Soil deposition m odeling was performed to \\nhelp determine which residential properties were likely to need removals of dioxin -contaminated soils just \\nnorth of the J. H.

The permit application details \\nthe weight fraction of polycyclic aromatic compounds in ga seous emissions from liquid creosote, \\nincluding naphthalene (44%), 2 -methylnaphthalene (13%), dibenzofuran (5%), acenaphthene (5%), 1 -\\nmethylnaphthalene (4%), fluorene (2%), and phenanthrene (1%) (Ref. 59, p. 9). \\nIn 2005 -2006, LRAPA conducted an air sampling study in response to community concerns regarding \\nemissions from J. H. Baxter. The study was designed to measure maximum downwind exposures in the \\nneighborhoods nearest to the J. H. Baxter facility adjacent to the north, northeast and northwest. The \\nprocess at the J. H. Baxter facility that generated the majority of the emissions used mixtures of creosote, \\noil and PCP to treat wood products for preservation. The various stages of treatment operations were \\nperfor med in drying kilns and large retorts using pressure and vacuum. Emissions occurred from many \\npoints, including vacuum pumps, tank vents, retort door openings, and treated product storage (Ref. 59, \\np. 3).\\nDetections of hazardous substances related to plant site processes correlated well with downwind \\nexposure. None of the facility -related hazardous substances were ever detected in samples that had no \\ndownwind exposure (Ref. 59, pp. 6, 9). LRAPA staff docume nted operations -related odors on the facility \\nand in the neighborhood to the north during many of the air sampling events as part of the 2005 -2006 \\nstudy. Resident complaints were received during these times and confirmed by LRAPA staff (Ref. 59, pp. \\n25-27, 29-34).\\nOther Facilities \\nTo assess attribution from the J. H. Baxter facility, multiple tools were used to examine other facilities \\nwithin the area. A search of available environmental records was conducted by Environmental Data \\nResources, Inc. (EDR), including environmental databases, historical Sanborn maps, his torical \\ntopographic maps, historical aerial photographs, and historical city directories (Ref. 94, p. 1; Ref. 95, p. \\n65\\nSE-Resident Population Threat    \\n \\n     \\n      \\n     \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n     \\n     \\n   \\n       \\n        \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n        \\n    \\n     \\n \\n    \\n      \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n       \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n      \\n   \\n     \\n       \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n       \\n   1; Ref. 96, p. 1; Ref. 97, p. 1; Ref. 98, p. 1; Ref. 99, p. 1). LRAPA provided information to EPA regarding \\nother potential contributors of emissions in the facility area (Ref. 100). Public records databases were \\nreviewed to identify other facilities within a mile radius of the J. H. Baxter facility that have CERCLA \\nhazardous substances associated with them (Ref. 98 , p. 3 ; Ref. 100 , p. 1 ). \\nThe recycling facility, directly neighboring J. H. Baxter to the east, reports some dioxins and metals \\nattributed to their emissions. This facility is situated on land owned by J. H. Baxter until 2007 and has \\nbeen in business since 2015. (Ref. 100, p. 1). There are multiple other facilities within 1.5 miles of the J. \\nH.Baxter site ( Ref. 93, pp. 1 -7). These facilities include lumber and sawmills , plywood, truss, cabinet and\\nveneer manufactures, recycling facilities , a landfill, auto sales, tire re -treaders, gas stations and garages, a\\nlaboratory, chemical products wholesaler, electroplating, surface coating, paint, resin, and glue\\nmanufactures, a printing facility, and sheet metal manufacturing (Ref. 94 ; Ref. 95; Ref. 96; Ref. 97; Ref.\\n98; Ref. 99; Ref. 100; Ref. 101; Ref. 102; Ref. 103; Ref. 104; Ref. 105; Ref. 106; Ref. 107; Ref. 108; Ref.\\n109; Ref. 110; Ref. 111; Ref. 112; see Ref. 93, pp. 1 -7 for specific page numbers). Some of these facilities\\nare associated with some of the same hazardous substances as those attributable to J. H. Baxter emissions\\nand wastes and thus could be contributing to the soil contamination in the larger site area. Most of these\\nfacilities, however, are located to the south of the J. H. Baxter site, beyond background soil sample\\nlocations (Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 93, p. 1).\\nJ. H. Baxter Attribution Summary \\nFor over 50 years, J. H. Baxter operated a wood treatment facility at its Roosevelt Boulevard location , \\nformerly Baxter Street, in southwest Eugene, Lane County, Oregon (Figure 1 and Figure 2 of this HRS \\ndocumentation record; Ref. 4, p. 13; Ref. 7, p. 18; Ref. 18, p. 6 ). The hazardous substances found in AOC \\nA, located on the J. H. Baxter facility property, and /or AOC B, located immediately north and downwind \\nof the J. H. Baxter facility and its emissions sources, are commonly associated with wood -treating \\noperations and include PAHs, PCP, dioxins, furans, metals, and pesticides (see Tables 2 through 16 of this \\nHRS documentation record ; Ref. 11, p. 23; Ref. 19, pp. 165, 166, 169 -171, 184; Ref. 20, pp. 1, 3; Ref. 23, \\np.1; Ref. 36, p. 1; Ref. 37, p. 2; Ref. 38, p. 1; Ref. 43, p. 2; Ref. 47, p. 1; Ref. 92, pp. 1, 5, 12 -35).\\nFor decades, residents living in the neighborhoods to the north and northeast of the J. H. Baxter facility \\nhave reported complaints to LRAPA concerning odor and symptoms of illness (Ref. 59, p. 14; Ref. 88, \\npp. 5, 7, 8, 10; Ref. 90, pp. 11 -12). An Air Contaminant Discharge Permit renewal application submitted \\nby J. H. Baxter in October 2003 indicated that most of J. H. Baxter’s VOC emissions were from creosote \\n(Ref. 59, p. 9). In 2005 -2006, an air sampling study was conducted in response to community concer ns \\nregarding emissions from J. H. Baxter. Detections of hazardous substances related to plant site processes \\ncorrelated well with downwind exposure (Ref. 59, pp. 3, 6, 9). \\nThe J. H. Baxter site is located in an industrialized area. Other facilities have been identified in the site \\nvicinity that may also be associated with some of the hazardous substances found in J. H. Baxter process \\nand waste samples and that are present at observed contamination l evels in AOCs A and B ( Ref. 93, p. 1 -\\n7); some of these other facilities may have contributed to the soil contamination in the area. However, soil \\ndeposition m odeling indicates dioxin s and metals were likely to be deposited in the neighborhood north \\nof the J. H. Baxter facility from J. H. Baxter’s emissions sources (Ref. 92, pp . 1, 5, 12 -35). Based on \\navailable evidence, including the soil deposition modeling , air emission data, the significantly lower \\ncontaminant levels found at background soil sample locations between the J. H. Baxter site and other \\nfacilities south of the site , downwind odor complaints directly tied to J. H. Baxter operations, samples of \\n66\\nSE-Resident Population Threat    \\n \\n    \\n       \\n     \\n      \\n    \\n  J. H.

H. Baxter facility operations (Ref. 21; Ref. 39, pp. 33 , 56, 59; \\nRef. 59, pp. 3, 14, 16, 35; Ref. 64; Ref. 92, p. 1 ; Table 17 of this HRS documentation record). \\n67\\nSE-Resident Population Threat    \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n   \\n      \\n      \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   5.1.1 RESIDENT POPULATION THREAT \\n5.1.1.1 LIKELIHOOD OF EXPOSURE\\nSa\\nmples documenting observed contamination  to residential properties north of the J.

Decades  of  releases  of  hazardous  substances  from  smelter  processes,  facility  operations  and  accidental  spills  to  the  \\nriver  have  caused discharges of granulated slag, liquid effluents and other releases. The primary facility known to have  \\ncontributed to hazardous substance contamination to the Upper Columbia River site is the Teck Metals Ltd. (Teck)  \\nfacility located in Trail,  British Columbia, Canada on the Columbia River  approximately 10 river miles upstream of the  \\ninternational boundary. The former Le Roi smelter  located in Northport, Washington also contributed, to a lesser extent, \\nhazardous substance contamination.  \\n \\n\\uf090 Site Contamination/Contaminants:  \\nUpland soils are contaminated with lead, arsenic, zinc, cadmium and other metals. Sediments in the river are  \\ncontaminated with slag and metals, including lead, zinc, cadmium, copper, and mercury. There is a significant quantity \\nof slag remaining in the river system. Surface  water sampling was conducted to assess concentrations of metals during  \\nvarious river conditions, locations, and depths. All samples were below human health drinking water and ecological  \\nsurface water screening levels.  \\n \\n\\uf094 Potential Impacts  on Surrounding Community/Environment :  \\nSmelter stack emissions have resulted in elevated lead and arsenic concentrations affecting approximately 120 -square \\nmiles of uplands properties, including residential properties and  tribal allotments. Lead  and arsenic pose a human health  \\nrisk to current and future residents through direct contact and incidental ingestion of soil, including from yards, gardens,  \\nand/or play areas. Metals including zinc, cadmium and lead in upland soils  pose a potential  risk to soil invertebrates,  \\nsmall birds, and mammals. River sediments are  contaminated with slag  and metals, including lead, zinc, cadmium,  \\ncopper, and mercury in exceedance of ecological  screening levels.  \\n \\n\\uf050 Response Activities (to  date):  \\nIn 2004, the EPA performed soil cleanup work at Le Roi smelter property and several nearby residential properties. \\nFrom  2015 to 2018, Teck American Inc., under EPA oversight, conducted soil cleanup at 18 residential properties  and \\na tribal  allotment. In 2020 and  2022,  the  EPA  conducted  additional  soil  cleanup  actions  at  residential  properties.  As  of  \\n2024,  the  EPA  has  performed  soil cleanup at 62 residential properties and 6 common use areas.  \\n \\n\\uf09b Need for NPL Listing:  \\nNPL listing is needed to ensure completion of  cleanup of both upland a nd aquatic portions of the site, including making \\nfederal funds available, if needed. Letters of support for placing this site on the NPL  were  received from the state, the  \\nConfederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, and the Spokane Tribe of India  \\n   \\n   [The description of the site (relea se) is based on info rmation available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS .

Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\niii Executive Summary  \\nSection 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the EPA prepare a list of national \\npriorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants \\nthroughout the United States. An original National Priorities List (NPL) was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). CERCLA requires that EPA update the list at least annually. \\nT\\nhis document provides responses to public comments received on the Upper Columbia River site, proposed on \\nMarch 7, 2024 (89 FR 16498). This site is being added to the NPL based on an evaluation under EPA’s Hazard Ranking System (HRS) in a final rule published in the Federal Register in December 2024. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n iv  Introduction \\nThis document explains the rationale for adding the Upper Columbia River site in Upper Columbia River, \\nWashington to the National Priorities List (NPL) of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites and provides responses to \\npublic comments received on this site li sting proposal. The EPA proposed this site to the NPL on March 7, 2024 \\n(89 FR 16498). This site is being added to the NPL based on an evaluation under the Hazard Ranking System \\n(HRS) in a final rule published in the Federal Register in December 2024. \\n \\nBackground of the NPL \\nIn 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \\n(CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. Sections 9601 et seq . in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. \\nCERCLA was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), \\nPublic Law No. 99-499, stat., 1613 et seq. To implement CERCLA, EPA promulgated the revised National Oil \\nand Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA Section 105 and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP, further \\nrevised by EPA on September 16, 1985 (50 FR 37624) and November 20, 1985 (50 FR 47912), sets forth \\nguidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. On March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666), EPA further revised the NCP in \\nresponse to SARA.  \\n Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the NCP include:  \\n \\ncriteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United \\nStates for the purpose of taking remedial action and, to the extent practicable, taking into account \\nthe potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action. \\n Removal action involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response to emergency conditions or on a \\nshort-term or temporary basis (CERCLA Section 101). Remedial action is generally long- term in nature and \\ninvolves response actions that are consiste nt with a permanent remedy for a release (CERCLA Section 101). \\nCriteria for placing sites on the NPL, which makes them eligible for remedial actions financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA, were included in the HRS. EPA promulgated the HRS as Appendix A of the NCP \\n(47 FR 31219, July 16, 1982). On December 14, 1990 (56 FR 51532), EPA promulgated revisions to the HRS in \\nresponse to SARA, and established the effective date for the HRS revisions as March 15, 1991. On January 9, \\n2017, EPA promulgated a further revision to the HRS that added a component for evaluating the threats posed by the intrusion of subsurface contamination into regularly occupied structures. These changes are consistent with, \\nand comply with, the statutory requirements of SARA.  \\n \\nSection 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended, requires that the statutory criteria provided by the HRS be used to \\nprepare a list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throu ghout the United States. The list, which is Appendix B of the NCP, is the NPL. \\n An original NPL of 406 sites was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). At that time, an HRS score \\nof 28.5 was established as the cutoff for listing because it yielded an initial NPL of at least 400 sites, as suggested \\nby CERCLA. The NPL has been expanded several times since then, most recently on September 5, 2024 (89 FR 72331). The Agency also has published a number of proposed rulemakings to add sites to the NPL. The most \\nrecent proposal was on September 5, 2024 (89 FR 72356). \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n v  Development of the NPL \\nThe primary purpose of the NPL is stated in the legislative history of CERCLA (Report of the Committee on \\nEnvironment and Public Works, Senate Report No. 96-848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 [1980]).  \\nThe priority list serves primarily informational purposes, identifying for the States and the public those facilities and sites or other releases which appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a \\nfacility or site on the list does not in itself refle ct a judgment of the activities of its owner or \\noperator, it does not require those persons to undertake any action, nor does it assign liability to \\nany person. Subsequent government actions will be necessary in order to do so, and these actions \\nwill be attended by all appropriate procedural safeguards. \\n The NPL, therefore, is primarily an informational and management tool. The identification of a site for the NPL is \\nintended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of the human health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA -\\nfinanced remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of sites EPA believes warrant further investigation. Finally, listing a site may , to the extent potentially responsible parties are \\nidentifiable at the time of listing, serve as notice to such parties that the Agency may initiate CERCLA -financed \\nremedial action.  \\n CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites among the known releases or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, and Section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certain \\nenumerated and other appropriate factors in doing so. Thus, as a matter of policy, EPA has the discretion not to \\nuse CERCLA to respond to certain types of releases. Where other authorities exist, placing sites on the NPL for \\npossible remedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Ther efore, EPA has chosen not to place certain \\ntypes of sites on the NPL even though CERCLA does not exclude such action. If, however, the Agency later \\ndetermines that sites not listed as a matter of policy are not being properly responded to, the Agency may consider \\nplacing them on the NPL. \\n \\nHazard Ranking System \\nThe HRS is the principal mechanism EPA uses to place uncontrolled waste sites on the NPL. It is a numerically \\nbased screening system that uses information from initial, limited investigations -- the preliminary assessment and \\nsite inspection -- to assess t he relative potential of sites to pose a threat to human health or the environment. HRS \\nscores, however, do not determine the sequence in which EPA funds remedial response actions, because the information collected to develop HRS scores is not sufficient i n itself to determine either the extent of \\ncontamination or the appropriate response for a particular site. Moreover, the sites with the highest scores do not necessarily come to the Agency\\'s attention first, so that addressing sites strictly on the basis of ranking would in \\nsome cases require stopping work at sites where it was already underway. Thus, EPA relies on further, more detailed studies in the remedial investigation/feasibility study that typically follows listing.  \\n The HRS uses a structured value analysis approach to scoring sites. This approach assigns numerical values to \\nfactors that relate to or indicate risk, based on conditions at the site. The factors are grouped into three categories. \\nEach category has a maxim um value. The categories are:  \\n \\n• likelihood that a site has released or has the potential to release hazardous substances into the \\nenvironment; Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\nvi •characteristics of the waste (e.g., toxicity and waste quantity); and\\n•targets (e.g., people or sensitive environments) affected by the release.\\nUnde\\nr the HRS, four pathways can be scored for one or more components and threats as identified below: \\n•Gr\\nound Water Migration (S gw)\\n— population\\n•Su\\nrface Water Migration (S sw)\\nThe following threats are evaluated for two separate migration components, overland/flood migration and\\nground water to surface water.\\n— drinking water\\n— human food chain\\n— sensitive environments\\n•Soi\\nl Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion (S sessi)\\n— Soil Exposure Component:\\no resident population\\no nearby population\\n— Subsurface Intrusion Component\\nopopulation\\n•Ai\\nr Migration (S a)\\n— population\\nAf\\nter scores are calculated for one or more pathways according to prescribed guidelines, they are combined using \\nthe following root -mean -square equation to determine the overall site score (S), which ranges from 0 to 100 : \\nIf all pathway scores are low, the HRS score is low. However, the HRS score can be relatively high even if only \\none pathway score is high. This is an important requirement for HRS scoring because some extremely \\ndangerous sites pose threats through only one pathway. For example, buried leaking drums of hazardous \\nsubstances can c ontaminate drinking water wells, but - - if the drums are buried deep enough and the substances \\nnot very volatile -- not surface water or air. \\nOther Mechanisms for Listing \\nThere are two mechanisms other than the HRS by which sites can be p laced  on the NPL. The first of these \\nmechanisms, authorized by the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), allows each State and Territory to designate one \\nsite as its high est priority regardless of score. The last mechanism,  authorized by the NCP at 40  CFR \\n300.425(c)(3), allows listing a site if it meets the following three requirements: \\n•Ag\\nency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued\\na health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release;\\n•EPA determines the site poses a significant threat to public health; andUpper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n vii  • EPA anticipates it will be more cost- effective to use its remedial authority than to use its emergency removal \\nauthority to respond to the site.  \\n \\nOrganization of this Document \\nThe following section contains EPA responses to site- specific public comments received on the proposal of the \\nUpper Columbia River site on March 7, 2024 (89 FR 16498). The site discussion begins with a list of \\ncommenters, followed by a site description, a summary of comments, and Agency responses to each comment.

Site Description \\nThe Upper Columbia River site (the Site) includes the release of metals from two smelters (Cominco1 and Le Roi \\nsmelters) to the Upper Columbia River and to soil . Associated contamination in the area is the combined result of \\nhistorical discharges of wastes and emissions from the two smelter operations, some of which has comingled in \\nsoils and surface water sediments. Upland soils in the area are contaminated with  metals, including arsenic and \\nlead. Sediments in the Upper Columbia River contain slag, a by- product of smelting, and are contaminated with \\n \\n1 The Cominco smelter is also known as the Trail Smelter and the Teck Cominco Smelter.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 5  metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc. There is a significant \\nquantity of slag present in the river system. The Site is being placed on the NPL based on an HRS evaluation of \\nthe Site documenting that contamination in sediments and soil achieve an NPL-eligible HRS site score. Although \\nthe contamination has comingled, the HRS documentation record at proposal also showed that releases associated with the Cominco smelter (approximately 10 miles upstream of the i nternational border) and releases associated \\nwith the Le Roi smelter (approximately 10 river miles downstream of the international border) each would independently achieve an NPL qualifying HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately. \\n \\nThe HRS evaluation of the Site scored the surface water migration pathway based on concentrations of hazardous substances in sediment s from the Upper Columbia River and the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway \\nbased on the concentrations of hazardous substances in soil . As presented in the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal, the Site, for HRS scoring purposes, includes contaminated sediments in the Upper Columbia River \\nbetween and downstream of the three scored HRS sources spanning approximately 35 river miles of the Columbia \\nRiver  from the U.S.-Canada border south and west to Marcus, Washington (see Figure 1 of this support document \\nbelow). The Site includes three scored sources: slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter, \\nwhich is currently owned by Teck Metals Ltd.  and located upstream of the international border in Canada (Source \\n1); contaminated soil on the  former Le Roi smelter facility in Northport, Washington (Source 2); and sluice box \\ndischarge associated with the former Le Roi smelter (Source 3). These sources have been documented to contain metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver, zinc, and mercury. The \\nreleases from the smelters have become comingled in the Upper Columbia River (at and downstream of the Le \\nRoi smelter) . In addition, an area of observed contamination (AOC) in soil in Northport, Washington was \\ndocumented in the HRS documentation record at proposal. R eleases from both facilities have also  become \\ncomingled in the AOC soil contamination.  \\nIn the evaluation of the surface water migration pathway, contamination and targets were scored in the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal for the U.S. portion of the zone of contamination, which encompasses a length of approximately 35 river miles. Both an observed release by direct observation and an observed release by \\nchemical analysis were documented. Observed releases by direct observation were scored based on Cominco smelter discharge of hazardous substance-bearing slag/effluent to the river and Le Roi smelter discharge of \\nhazardous substance -bearing slag to the river. An observed release by chemical analysis based on the \\nconcentrations of metals (i.e., antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc) in sediment s was established in the HRS documentation record at proposal. Targets in the surface water migration \\npathway (i.e., fishery, wetlands, and a federal- designated threatened species habitat) were evaluated as subject to \\nLevel II concentrations. \\n \\nIn the evaluation of the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, t he AOC \\nis located in a residential area to the southwest of the former Le Roi smelter and is defined by a polygon bounded \\nby soil contamination meeting HRS observed contamination criteria (i.e., locations showing lead and arsenic at \\nconcentrations significantly above published background levels and collected from the top 2 feet of soil). This \\nAOC is attributable to historical aerial deposition from both smelters. Historical smelter smokestack emissions \\nfrom both smelters have resulted in upland residential soil contamination; residential populations subject to Level \\nI and Level II contamination for HRS scoring purposes  associated with the AOC were documented in the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal for the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion \\npathway.  \\n \\nSince 2003, numerous EPA removal activities have occurred in and around the Northport, Washington area, inc\\nluding several removal site evaluations (RSEs). In 2003 and 2004, Northport residential and commercial \\nproperties with lead concentrations in soil greater than the removal action level  of 1,000 milligrams per kilogram \\n(mg/kg ) were identified for a time-critical removal action (TCRA). In 2004, a removal action was conducted at \\nthe former Le Roi smelter and residential areas with the excavated contaminat ed soils being consolidated at an 11-\\nacre area of the Le Roi smelter site. In 2014 and 2016, residential properties and tribal allotments were sampled. \\nFor these sampling events, a removal action level of 700 mg/kg for lead in soil was evaluated.  In an EPA dispute Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 6  decision issued in 2015, EPA stated an intent to select a lower removal action level for lead in soil, lowering the \\naction level from 1,000 mg/kg to 700 mg/kg. Based on analytical results from residential soil sampling, TCRAs \\nwere conducted in 2015, 2017, and 2018 using a removal action level of 700 mg/kg. The EPA conducted \\nadditional RSE s at properties within the town of Northport that were sampled in 2003 and 2004 as described \\nabove and found to have lead in soil at concentrations near or above 700 mg/kg. In 2020, soil cleanup activities \\nwere conducted  using a removal action level of 700 mg/kg. The EPA conducted a subsequent RSE in the \\nresidential area of Northport in 2021. TCRAs were conducted at additional properties in 2022 using a removal action level for lead in soil of 700 mg/kg. In 2024, additional TCRAs were conducted using a removal action level \\nof 200 mg/kg.  \\n \\nAddi\\ntional investigations have been ongoing at the Site, including a remedial investigation and feasibility study \\n(RI/FS). The RI/FS is underway as part of the 2006 Settlement Agreement between Teck Cominco Metals Ltd., Teck Cominco American Incorporated (TAI), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and the EPA; there is no\\n \\nsettlement agreement for funding or performance of a potential remedial action . In February 2021, the EPA \\nreleased a Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) for the Upper Columbia River site, which was conducted as \\npart of the ongoing RI/FS. An Upland Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment and an Aquatic Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment are also underway. The ongoing RI/FS will guide subsequent stages of the CERCLA process, \\nand information from completed, ongoing, and subsequent investigations will inform the ultimate extent of s ite-\\nrelated contamination. Completed site investigations and remedial work, as well as time critical removal actions,  \\nwere considered  in the HRS evaluation of the Site, and the current conditions in sediments and soil at the Site \\nachieve an HRS site score, describ ed above, that is eligible for placement on the NPL as presented in the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal.   \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 7   \\nFi\\ngure 1.

Summary of Comments  \\nThe state of Washington, the Spokane Tribe of Indians , the Confederated Tribes of the Co lville Reservation2 the \\nLands Council, the Upper Columbia United Tribes , the Spokane Mountaineers, and 20 citizens supported or did \\nnot oppose placing the Site on the NPL.  \\n \\nTeck American Incorporated3 (TAI) , the Stevens County Board of County Commissioners4 (hereinafter referred \\nto as Stevens County), the Eastern Washington Council of Governments (EWCOG), the Lincoln County \\nCommissioners (Lincoln County), South Columbia Basin Irrigation District (SCBID), East Columbia Basin Irrigation District (ECBID) , Quincy- Columbia Basin Irrigation District (QCBID) , Board of Commissioners, \\nCounty of Benton ( Benton County ), the Rimrock Cabin Owners Association, and 47 citizens opposed placing the \\nSite on the NPL. TAI also requested that the EPA consider its comments prior to adding the Site on the NPL.  \\n TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens provided comments on the supporting data and documentation. TAI \\nand Stevens County questioned the data included in the HRS documentation record at proposal, asserting that \\nadditional data and information were available as a part of the ongoing RI/FS. TAI stated that “arbitrarily limited \\ndata and completed studies” were used. TAI commented that evaluating the Site with the HRS is inappropriate \\ngiven the level of investigation into the Site already completed.  \\n \\nIn discussing the Site as presented at proposal, TAI and Stevens County commented  on perceived difference s \\nbetween the site as described in previous EPA communication and the Site as scored. TAI and Stevens County asserted that past descriptions of the Site pointed to uplands residential soil contamination , while the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal primarily focuses on the sediment contamination in the Upper Columbia River.   \\nTAI questioned the inclusion of the Northport area as part of the Site asserting  that the Northport area has \\nhistorically been treated as a separate site from the Upper Columbia River. TAI disagreed with comingling of the \\nsmelters’ contamination in soil as the basis for inclusion of the Northport area as part of the site, asserting that \\nCominco smelter aerial emissions are limited to the smelter in British Columbia and a few miles into Washington .  \\n Several commenters submitted comments discussing possible effects of the NPL designation. TAI, Stevens County, and multiple citizens expressed concern for how liability will be assigned for the contamination and/or \\nwhat the sources of funding for remediati on of the contamination will be. Stevens County, Lincoln County, \\nSCBID, QCBID , ECBID  and 20 citizens provided comments discussing the possible impacts to the region, \\nincluding negative economic impacts, as a result of a NPL designation.  \\n Several commenters opposed to listing provided comments discussing issues related to the listing process. \\nComments related to the listing process include:  \\n \\n• Comments questioning the rationale for listing given that the Site is undergoing an RI/FS.  \\n• Comments asserting that the HRS is intended for a limited evaluation of a Site in the preliminary stages of the evaluation process.  \\n• Assertions that there is no need for listing based on the conditions at the Site.  \\n \\n2 See the December 6, 2023 , letter from the Confederated Tribes of the Col ville Reservation  to EPA, included as Attachment \\nA of this support document . \\n3 Teck American Incorporated  submitted comments on the proposed listing and is an affiliate of Teck Metals Ltd. , the owner \\nand operator of the Trail smelter  (also referred to as the Cominco Smelter and the Teck Cominco Smelter)  in Canada .  \\n4 The Stevens County Board of County Commissioners submitted comments on its behalf along with comments on behalf of \\nthe Eastern Washington Council of Governments. (See Docket ID EPA -HQ-OLEM -2024- 0068 -0080 on regulations.gov  fo r \\nthe combined comment submission by Stevens County and the Eastern Washington Council of Governments.) Comments \\nspecifically authored by the Eastern Washington Council of Governments were included as Attachment E of the combined comment submission.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 9  • Assertions that information about the Site has been delayed or withheld.  \\n• Requests that listing not occur until after the completion of the RI/FS for the Site.  \\n• Comments that ecological benefits are overdue and ineffective.  \\n \\nAdditionally, in Attachments A5 and D6 to its comment submission, in opposition of NPL listing and \\ndisagreement with the state concurrence with listing,  Stevens County stated that they “do not relinquish” their \\n“authority as elected officials over to the governor.”  \\n \\nMultiple commenters discussed whether the risk posed by the Site is sufficient for NPL placement, commenting  \\nthat: \\n \\n• The Site does not pose a risk to human health.  \\n• Fish from the Upper Columbia River are generally not impacted .  \\n• Soil contamination at residential properties is being or has been addressed via removal actions or remedial \\nactivities .  \\n• The quality of water in the Columbia River is clean and/or meets water quality standards.  \\n• The area is clean except for rubbish.  \\n In questioning technical aspects of the HRS scoring of the Site, TAI commented that slag is not a hazardous \\nsubstance under CERCLA , and that the solid waste definition in 40 CFR 261.4 excludes slag. TAI asserted that \\nsince slag is not a hazardous substance under CER CLA, using slag to determine the hazardous waste quantity for \\nSource 1 is incorrect and misleading.  \\n In challenging the evaluation of the surface water migration pathway, commenters asserted that : \\n \\n• The slag in the river is unlikely to release metals.   \\n• Contamination is buried in sediment at deeper depths , and it would be safer to leave it as-is than risking \\nrereleasing the associated metals by stirring sediments during removal processes .  \\n• The other possible sources not scored section of the HRS documentation record at proposal is incomplete  \\nbecause it does not discuss other possible origins of contamination .  \\n• The waste characteristics factor category value was inappropriately calculated and overestimated . \\n• Fish from the Columbia River are generally safe for consumption.  \\n• The Site may not be the driver of fish advisories in place for sensitive groups .  \\n In commenting on the evaluation of the soil exposure component, commenters asserted  that: \\n \\n• The soil exposure component would no t achieve an NPL -eligible score by itself .  \\n• The extent of residential contamination described in general EPA communications is an overstatement of \\nthe residential land use area.  \\n• Areas identified as residential for scoring purposes or future cleanup purposes inappropriately included \\nforest, industrial, and commercial areas.  \\n• Only limited soil contamination remains because properties above the action level have been remediated.  \\n \\nIn this support document, the EPA responds to comments submitted on the March 2024 proposed listing of the \\nUpper Columbia River  site. After consideration of these items, the HRS site score remains unchanged , and the \\nEPA is appropriately placing the site on the NPL.  \\n \\n \\n5 Attachment A of Stevens County’s comment submission is a January 16, 2024 , letter to Calvin Terada, EPA.  \\n6 Attachment D of Stevens County’s comment submission is a January 16, 2024 , letter to Jay Inslee, Governor, s tate of \\nWashington.

T hey commented  \\nthat NPL listing will bring access to resources needed for cleanup of the Site.  \\nThe Spokane Tribe of Indians expresse d support for NPL lis ting, referring  to the negative impacts associated w ith \\nSite-related c ontamination , such as health and  welfare impacts, economi c security,  and political integrity of the \\nSpokane Tribe of Indians. The Spokane Tribe of Indians asserted that delays have occurred as a resu lt of the Site \\nnot being placed on the NPL and the RI/FS process is still ongoing. O ther reason s for support cited by the \\nSpokane Tribe of Indians include the ability of the EPA to use federal funding, control of cleanup , cost recovery, \\nthe ability o f the EPA to  better c haracterize the  contamination.   \\nThe Spokane Tribe of Indians concurred wit h the propose d listing of the Site on the NPL assumi ng that the Site is \\n“meant to encompass the Upper Columbia River from the U.S. Canadia n border and downstream , including Lake \\nRoosevelt, to the Grand Coulee Dam.” The Spokane Tribe of Indians commente d that the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal provided an incomplete characterizati on of the contamination i n that it focuse d on the area \\nfrom the border to Marcus , Washington, and requeste d that future remedial inve stigations and  response activities \\ncharacteri ze the  lower r iver.  \\nThe Upper Columbia United Tribes supported the proposal to add the Site to the NPL, stating that NPL placement \\nwould allow for fundi ng, legal status , and resources t o address contamination affecting the land, water, and \\nwildlife. T he U pper C olumbia U nited Tribes asserted t hat site-related co ntaminants, suc h as metals, may be \\nposing a risk to human health a nd the environment. T hey stated that the “ federal government should dedicate \\nmore resources to address t he legacy of  heavy  metal p ollution  in the waters and lands of the uppe r Columbia \\nRegion.” They als o stated that the government should procee d “in recovering clea n and s afe environments in \\nsupport of these recovery efforts and the communities who stand to benefit from them.” \\nMultiple citizens and the Spokane Mountaineers support ed listing. O ne citizen provided support for listing i f \\naccess to the Upper Columbia River or Lake Roosevelt is not restricted. A citizen commented that CERCLA \\nactivities have fallen short in addressing sites in the past. One citizen also asserted that negative economic impacts \\n7 See the December 6, 2023 , letter from the Confederated Tribes of the Col ville Reservation  to EPA, included as Attachment \\nA of this support document . Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 11  may not necessarily occur and property values may not necessarily decrease. Additional reasons for support \\nprovided by commenters include: \\n \\n• Cleanup of s ite-related contamination  \\n• Protection of human health, wildlife, and/or the environment  \\n• Possible negotiations and funding for cleanup  \\n• Positive impacts to the economy as a result of remediation of contamination  \\n• The possible removal of buried waste at the former Le Roi smelter property.  \\n \\nThe Lands Council and a citizen expressed a request for cooperation with tribes in addressing the Site.  \\n \\nResponse : The EPA has added the Upper Columbia River site to the NPL. Listing makes a site eligible for \\nremedial action funding under CERCLA, and the EPA will examine the site to determine what response, if any, is \\nappropriate. Actual funding may not necessarily be undertaken in the precise order of HRS scores, however, and upon more detailed investigation may not be necessary at all in some cases. The EPA will determine the need for \\nusing Superfund monies for remedial activities on a site-by- site basis, considering the NPL ranking, State \\npriorities, further site investigation, other response alternatives, and other factors as appropriate.  \\n \\nRegarding the Site definition and extent of S ite, please see sections 3.4, Site Description and Definition , and 3.5, \\nExtent of Site, of this support document.  \\n  Regarding a commenter’s concern about access to the Upper Columbia River, the EPA acknowledges the \\ncommenter ’s concern and notes that access to the river is not determined by the listing decision.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.2 Community Involvement \\nComment : TAI , Stevens County, and six citizens submitted comments about EPA communications to the public, \\nthe level of community involvement, and the EPA’s coordination with local government.  \\n \\nTAI stated that the EPA made incorrect statements in public communications about benefits the EPA may gain \\nthrough NPL designation. TAI asserted that the EPA’s news release about the proposed listing of the Upper \\nColumbia River site on the NPL “incorrectly suggests that a site listing automatically ensures EPA can access \\nSuperfund dollars: ‘Listing the site on the NPL allows EPA to access Superfund dollars for cleanup activities \\nwhich can also help ensure a more timely cleanup.’”8 TAI commented NPL listing makes sites eligible for federal \\nfunding, and it  does not guarantee that funding. TAI also pointed to a local newspaper article in which an EPA \\nspokesman stated that NPL listing gives the EPA “access to  legal tools that could compel action if needed.”9 \\nHowever, TAI argued that NPL listing “does not, in itself, reflect the responsible parties or the bases of their \\nliability, require those entities to take any action, determine whether remediation is possible or even necessary or \\nthe extent of any potential remediation, or assign liability to any person or entity.” TAI also argued that NPL \\nlisting does not give the EPA additional enforcement authority.  \\n \\nStevens County and multiple citizens discussed the level of community involvement and coordination with local \\ngovernment. Stevens County commented that while the EPA has indicated that it would like to work with the \\ncommunity and local officials to ensure contaminated areas that have been identified are within acceptable levels, \\n \\n8 TAI cited a March 5, 2024 EPA news release available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -\\ncolumbia -river -wa-superfund- list. TAI quoted the statement, “L isting the site on the NPL allows EPA to access Superfund \\ndollars for cleanup activities which can also help ensure a more timely cleanup. ” \\n9 TAI cited a March 5, 2024 article in The Spokesman -Review available at \\nhttps://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/mar/05/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -to-superf/ .  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 12  it has been not included in the process. Five  citizens commented that local officials’ input has been ignored, and \\nthree of these citizens argued that local officials would be communicating there is a problem if concerning levels \\nof contamination were present in the Upper Columbia River area. Five ci tizens also stated that the urgency to list \\nthe Site on the NPL is politically motivated.  \\n \\nStevens County stated that “ local elected officials do not concur with EPA that NPL listing is needed or warranted \\nat this time .” Stevens County asserted that it is “willing to help” and “EPA regional staff should be focused on \\nworking with the local governments.” Stevens County commented that it is willing to cooperate to find solutions \\nfor health, safety, and ecological concerns. Two citizens commented that government officials opposed the designation, and one of these citizens suggested that local officials should be consulted about the issue.  \\n \\nStevens County asserted that EPA provided insufficient information and communication. It commented that:  \\n \\n• The EPA has delayed and withheld information .  \\n• A local group received a draft document— the draft Upland Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment \\n(BERA) —from the EPA for comment while the local government was not given the same opportunity.  \\n• The messaging provided by the EPA suggested soil contamination is the issue at the Site although the \\nscoring of the Site relied on other data.  \\n• Data used in the listing, including compounds and metals other than lead, were not provided to the local government.  \\n• The EPA has not been transparent in the process, and misleading information about the process has been provided.  \\n• The EPA provided different information in public meetings than in the proposal to add the Site to the NPL.  \\n• The Governor provided a concurrence letter to the EPA without obtaining input from the local government.  \\n• Local public health offices were not consulted.  \\n One citizen requested that, before allowing federal government and EPA involvement, local residents should be \\nallowed to participate and given a controlling vote. Two  citizen s asserted that local individuals would be more \\nfamiliar with the area. A citizen also commented that the local community should be given opportunities for input and discussion along with local voting options for agreed-upon cleanup.  \\n \\nResponse : The EPA communicated with  the public frequently during the site assessment and RI/FS stage s and has \\nmade multiple efforts to involve the community and other interested parties throughout the RI/FS  and site \\nassessment stages. The EPA will continue community engagement efforts for the Site throughout the CERCLA \\nprocess.   \\n Regarding the procedures used to list the Site on the NPL, the EPA complied with all relevant administrative \\nrequirements. The HRS evaluation of the Site is consistent with the HRS regulation and the Administrative \\nProcedure Act (APA). The HRS documentation record at proposal and this support document clearly document \\nthat the EPA has complied with the HRS regulation; this support document addresses all comments on the \\nproposed listing of this Site, including those comments that challenge compliance with the HRS, and shows that \\nHRS requirements have been met in every aspect of the evaluation of this Site.  \\n \\nAs part of the standard community involvement process, the Superfund program offers numerous opportunities \\nfor public participation at NPL sites. The EPA Regional Office develop s a Community Involvement Plan (CIP) \\nbefore  remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS)  field work begins . The CIP is the “work plan” for Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 13  community relations activities that the EPA will conduct during the entire cleanup process. In developing a CIP, \\nRegional staff interview s State and local officials and interested citizens to learn about citizen concerns, site \\nconditions, and local history. This information is used to formulate a schedule of activities designed to keep citizens apprised and to keep the EPA aware of community concerns. Typical community relations activities \\ninclude: \\n \\n• Public meetings where  the EPA presents a summary of technical information regarding the site and \\ncitizens can ask questions or comment  \\n• Small, informal public sessions where  EPA representatives are available to citizens \\n• Development and distribution of fact sheets to keep citizens up to date on site activities \\n \\nFor each site , an “information repository” is established, usually in a librar y or town hall  and/or on an EPA Web \\nsite, containing reports, studies, fact sheets, and other documents containing information about the site. The  EPA \\nRegional Office continually updates the repository and must ensure that the facility housing the repository has copying capabilities. For the Upper Columbia River site, t he EPA Regional Office developed a CIP for the Site in \\n2004 before the start of the RI/FS, and information repositories have been established in libraries in the local communities . \\n \\nIn addition to meeting federal requirements, the  EPA ensure s that community involvement is a continuing activity \\ndesigned to meet the specific needs of the community. Anyone wanting information should contact the Community Involvement Coordinator in the appropriate EPA Regional Office.  \\n To provide information about the ongoing progress at the Upper Columbia River site , because a remedial \\ninvestigation/feasibility study is ongoing, the EPA maintains an Upper Columbia River Study Area webpage \\n(https://www.epa.gov/columbiariver/upper- columbia -river -study- area). This webpage provides the community \\nand other interested parties information regarding the Site status, publicly available documents, including fact sheets, and other relevant site- specific information. The EPA hosted numerous outreach events in the community \\nregarding the Site . These outreach activities have included public meetings and briefings with members of \\nCongress and local officials. Table 1 below presents a selected list of outreach events the EPA conducted prior to proposal. \\n \\nT\\nable 1: Recent Upper Columbia River Outreach Events  \\n \\nDatea  EPA Outreach Event  \\nOctober 15, 2019  Northport public meeting on HHRA  \\nOctober 16, 2019  Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation public meeting on HHRA  \\nNovember 20, 2019  HHRA update presentation at the Lake Roosevelt Forum conference  \\nJune 10, 2020  HHRA overview public webinar  \\nJuly 15, 2020  HHRA overview public webinar ( repeat ed presentation)  \\nJune 28, 2023  Brief ed congressional representatives  on Site update and NPL proposal   \\nJune 28, 2023  Conversation with Teck  on NPL proposal  \\nJuly 24, 2023  Brief ed Northeast  Tri-County Health Dept . and W ashington  Dept. of Health  \\non NPL proposal  \\nJuly 17, 2023  Brief ed Stevens County Commissioners on NPL proposal  \\nJuly 24, 2023  Brief ed Ferry County Commissioners on NPL proposal  \\nAugust 7, 2023  Brief ed Lincoln County Commissioners  on NPL proposal  \\nAugust 9, 2023  Brief ed Northport Town Council  and Mayor Karene Balcom  on NPL proposal  \\nSeptember  19, 2023  Brief ed Grant County Commissioners on NPL proposal  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 14  Datea  EPA Outreach Event  \\nSeptember  29, 2023  Eastern W ashington  Council of Governments meeting  \\nNovember  27, 2023  Citizens for a Clean Columbia informal meeting with members and potential \\nguests to brief on Site update and NPL proposal (with Q&A)  \\nNovember  28, 2023  Brief ed U.S. Senators Murray and Cantwell ’s staff \\nNovember  28, 2023  Site update with Southern, Eastern, and Quincy Irrigation Districts  \\nJanuary 18, 2024  Brief ed Representative  McMorris Rodgers ’ staff \\nJuly 17, 2024  EPA and Citizens for Clean Columbia co-hosted a community meeting at \\nNorthport High School  \\na – The EPA notes that this table reflects recent outreach events. Additional outreach activities have been conducted by EPA  \\nRegion 10 dating back to 200 0 regarding the Upper Columbia River site.  \\n \\nAdditionally, as part of the EPA’s Technical Assistance Services for Communities  program , the EPA awarded \\nCitizens for a Clean Columbia a technical assistance contract to fund participation and a review of the RI/FS \\nprocess. The EPA provides further information regarding community technical assistance on its Upper Columbia \\nRiver Study A rea webpage.  \\n \\nRegarding coordination with the public and other interested parties or stakeholders, t he CERCLA process \\nencourages public participation , including potentially responsible parties. The public can comment during the \\ncomment period (typically 60 days) after a site is proposed for listing on the NPL and during the time the EPA is \\nevaluating and selecting a remedy. The EPA may also hold a publ ic hearing during the latter decision -making \\nperiod. If private parties conduct remedial actions under a consent decree between the EPA and the parties, the decree is also subject to public comment. The EPA believes that the above process offers the public sufficient opportunity to present facts and opinions germane to its decision-making.   \\n Regarding comments addressing the tools that become accessible to the EPA as a result of  listing a site, the EPA \\nstatements referred to by TAI and communicated to the public regarding funding and legal tools are correct. In \\npublic communications the EPA stated that NPL listing allow s the EPA “to access Superfund dollars for cleanup \\nactivities .” This statement did not assert that such funding is automatic at listing  or that remedial action is \\nautomatic. Listing a site on the NPL also gives the EPA “access to legal tools that could compel action if needed.” This statement by the EPA about access to legal tools does not imply that the NPL listing itself assigns liability or \\nrequires specific remedial actions.  With NPL listing, EPA may use federal funds to advance CERCLA response \\nactions when negotiations with a potentially responsible party or parties (PRPs) are not successful or become protracted, or if a PRP is not in compliance with an enforcement order or settlement agreement . The EPA would \\nthen seek to recover its costs from the PRP (s). This approach incentivizes PRPs to negotiate or to comple te work  \\nbecau se the cost for a private party to conduct work is generally less expensive than costs incurred by the EPA . \\nBoth the EPA statement on potential funding from an NPL listing and enforcement tools that may be available \\nfrom listing are consistent with the explanation of the limited significance of the NPL outlined in the Federal \\nRegister  notice proposing this Site to the NPL (89 FR 16498). \\n Regarding the information and data used to support the proposed addition of the Site to the NPL, please see \\nsection 3.3, Adequacy of Documentation, of this support document for a detailed discussion.  \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  \\n \\n3.3 Adequacy of Documentation  \\nComment: TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens asserted that insufficient data or documentation were \\navailable to support placing the Site on the NPL.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 15  TAI and Stevens County commented that the Site has been extensively studied as part of the RI/FS and these data \\nwere not included in the HRS scoring of the Site. TAI commented that the HRS is not appropriate for the Site \\nbecause of the extensive investigation already completed for the Site. Stevens County stated that the HRS scoring \\nis incomplete. TAI stated that the HRS scoring “did not incorporate the bulk of the RI/FS data” and used “arbitrarily limited data and completed studies” despite the availabilit y of additional technical information that is \\nsometimes more current and comprehensive. Stevens County also commented that prior data are available from the RI/FS process on the Upper Columbia River. TAI asserted that the most recent data from the RI/FS sh ould be \\nused to reflect the current risk posed by the Site.   In discussing the data used, Stevens County stated that the HRS scoring used “other unscientific data to list the \\narea on the NPL.” Stevens County commented that HRS scoring should be completed based on the known risk \\nassociated with the Site as opposed to “guesses.” Stevens County commented that data for compounds and metals \\nother than lead used in the documentation to support the proposed listing were not provided to it.  \\n \\nStevens County and 10 citizens made additional assertions regarding the adequacy of the supporting \\ndocumentation. Stevens County asserted that it is unclear why the Site achieved an NPL eligible HRS site score given that no human health risk is associated with the Site and no c onclusive data on sediment contamination \\nfrom the Upper Columbia River are present. Four  citizens commented that the proposed designation lacks \\nscientific evidence to support the decision. Four  citizens commented that placing the Site on the NPL prior to the \\ncompletion of the RI/FS suggests that the decision is being made without important data. Three citizens commented that there is a lack of scientific data to support the NPL designation or scope of the Site because the RI/FS process  is still underway. Two citizens expressed opposition to the proposed NPL designation until \\nongoing studies have been completed and verified. As part of the assertion that available data were incomplete, three citizens stated that there are no blood test r esults for children living in the impacted area that would support \\nlisting the Site on the NPL.   Regarding availability of documentation and data, one citizen commented that the five documents for review did \\nnot include data tables or a map. This citizen also asserted that the fact sheet appears to indicate that remediation \\noccurred at the areas with higher contamination and no associated data were provided.  \\n \\nResponse : \\n The data relied upon in the HRS documentation record at proposal are of sufficient quantity and type \\nfor the purposes of scoring the Site and Site placement on the NPL. Relevant data for the NPL listing were \\nincluded in the HRS documentation record referen ces at proposal and are available to the public via the Site \\ndocket10. Documents referenced in the HRS documentation record at proposal were available to the public upon \\nrequest via the Region 10 S ite docket at the time of proposal  as described in the Federal Register notice proposing \\nthe Site to the NPL . The docket for the Site at the time of proposal was also sufficient for the public to review the \\nHRS evaluation of the Site. As shown in other sections of this support document, the scoring of the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway were \\nsupported in the HRS documentation record at proposal and achieved an HRS site score a bove the NPL listing \\nthreshold of 28.50.  \\nThe EPA used appropriate levels of data and investigation in determining the HRS score for the Site consistent \\nwith HRS regulation. As explained in the preamble in the Federal Register notice promulgating the 1990 HRS (55 FR 51533, December 14, 1990), Congress, in discussing the substantive standards against which HRS \\nrevisions could be assessed, stated:  \\n \\n10 The EPA maintains dockets for the Site at EPA Headquarters and Region 10, which are available to the public per the \\ninstructions provided in the Federal Register  notice proposing the Site to the NPL (89 FR 16498 March 7, 2024). The \\ndocuments in the EPA Headquarters docket explain the basis for the HRS evaluation of the Site (e.g., the HRS documentation \\nrecord with scoresheets and figures, the narrative summary, etc.) and have been made available online at regulations.gov . The \\ndocuments in the EPA Region 10 docket for the Site include the documents in the EPA Headquarters docket along with all \\nreference documents identified in the HRS documentation record at proposal.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 16   \\nT\\nhis standard is to be applied within the context of the purpose for the National Priorities List; \\ni.e., identifying for the States and the public those facilities and sites which appear to warrant \\nremedial actions…. Th e standard does not require the Hazard Ranking System to be equivalent to \\ndetailed risk assessments, quantitative or qualitative, such as might be performed as part of \\nremedial actions. This standard requires the Hazard Ranking System to rank sites as accur ately as \\nthe Agency believes is feasible using information from preliminary assessments and site inspections.... Meeting this standard does not require long- term monitoring or an accurate \\ndetermination of the full nature and extent of contamination at sites or the projected levels of \\nexposure such as might be done during remedial investigations and feasibility studies. This provision is intended to ensure that the Hazard Ranking System performs with a degree of \\naccuracy appropriate to its role in expeditiously identifying candidate s for respo nse actions . [H.R. \\nRep. No. 962, 99th Cong. 2nd Sess. at 199-200 [1986]]  \\n \\nIn addition, the HRS documentation record at proposal explained that other data that were not used in the HRS \\nscoring of the Site were available and included in the references supporting the HRS documentation record at proposal. These data were not include d in the scoring or in the body of the HRS documentation record itself due \\nto the volume of available data but were available to the public in the HRS documentation record references at the time of proposal. The Site achieved an HRS score sufficient to war rant NPL listing based on the HRS scoring \\npresented in the HRS documentation record at proposal and the cited reference documents used to support that scoring. Additional data were not necessary for the HRS scoring of the Site to achieve and NPL -qualifying site \\nscore but were included in the record for the Site as additional evidence supporting the presence of Site- related \\ncontamination in sediments. Page 76 of the HRS  documentation record at proposal stated:  \\n \\nAdditional Sediment samples confirming an Observed Release by Chemical Analysis :  \\n It should be noted that there are additional sediment samples from the 2019 Teck Phase 3 \\nSediment Study which meet the criteria for an observed release to surface water; however, they \\nwere not included due to the sheer volume of data. These samples were not included because they \\nwere collected near sediment samples already included in documenting an observed release to \\nsurface water. In addition, the current samples and associated data used resulted in a maximized score of the surface water migration pathway. These sediment samples and associated data are \\nincluded in References 35 and 36.\\n \\n Moreover, although these additional data provide supplementary information regarding the Site,  these data were \\nnot necessary to score the Site because the data relied upon sufficiently documented that the Site achieved an \\nNPL -eligible HRS site score of 28.50 or greater. As shown throughout this support document, the comments \\nsubmitted have not identified errors in the HRS factor values that would result in the Site score falling below the listing threshold of 28.50. The Site qualifies for addition to the NP L because it has achieved an HRS score greater \\nthan 28.50, as is demonstrated in the HRS documentation record and this support document. This score is based on the facts presented in the HRS documentation record and this support document. Achieving a site score of \\n28.50 or greater indicates that the Site is eligible for inclusion on the NPL and therefore warrants further \\ninvestigation.  \\n \\nRegarding the citizen ’s comments asserting that data tables  were not provided  at proposal, the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal included data tables summarizing the data relied on to score relevant HRS factors. The HRS documentation record at proposal was made available to the public on regulations.gov at the \\ntime of proposal and in the EPA Headquarters and EPA Region 10 dockets. References supporting the HRS scoring of the Site, including source documents for the analytical data, were identified in the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal’s reference list and were available to the public, upon request, at the time of proposal via the \\nEPA Region 10 Site docket.   \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 17  This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.4 Site Description and Definition \\nComment : Several commenters submitted comments concerning the general description of the Site, and whether \\nthe Site as scored is consistent with prior EPA communications and investigations. TAI commented that the proposed Site is inconsistent with the EPA’s public communications for moving forward with the proposal for adding the Site to the NPL, which have centered on residential soil contamination. TAI commented that, while \\nsoil contamination near Northport was emphasized in communications to the public, the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal instead focused on the concentration of metals in sediment s. TAI stated that “[i]n fact, EPA \\nomitted all but a small portion of the upland areas from the HRS scoring entirely, with the score premised on the Upper Columbia River.”  \\n \\nThe Government of Canada commented that the 2006 Settlement Agreement to conduct the RI/FS and a \\ndescription of the ongoing RI/FS should be included in the HRS documentation record and “introductory \\nremarks.”  \\n Stevens County commented on a perceived difference between the EPA’s communication and the Site as scored, \\nstating:  \\n \\nThe scoring of this proposal is arbitrary and capricious, or at the very least is skewed to fit the desired outcome of NPL listing as a priority site. We have received no communications on \\ncontamination on river sediment, yet the scoring to list this site seems to be based on river \\nsediment data as opposed to the uplands area where lead levels are a little higher and the ninth \\ncircuit court of appeals has ruled that air deposition is not the responsibility of the Tech [sic] \\nsmelter in Canada to clean up and studies have been done. The messaging and purpose of this \\nproposed listing is to clean up the higher lead levels in the Uplands Residential areas where \\nstudies have been conducted and no responsible party exists for clean up of residential properties \\nnear Northport and the Canadian Border.  Yet this messaging to us local governments and citizens \\nthroughout the area was only based on the Uplands data.  \\n Stevens County also asserted that the EPA’s messaging has focused on lead contamination, while the information \\nsupporting the proposed listing of the Site includes other compounds and metals in addition to lead.  \\n \\nResponse: The HRS documentation record at proposal sufficiently described the Site as evaluated for HRS \\nscoring purposes and provided sufficient description for the purpose of identifying the Site for possible NPL placement.  \\n As indicated on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, for HRS scoring purposes, the Site is the release of metals  to the Upper Columbia River and soil from former operations at the two smelters , Cominco and \\nLe Roi. The Site was described on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal as being located in the northeast portion of Washington State and contaminated due to historical disposal and discharges of wastes and \\nemissions from smelter operations, and comingling in soils and surfac e water sediments. Sediments in the river \\nare contaminated with slag and metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc, and a significant quantity of slag still remains in the Upper Columbia River. Upland soils at the Site are \\ncontaminated with metals including arsenic and lead. The HRS evaluation of the Site scored the surface water \\nmigration pathway based on concentrations of hazardous substances in sediments in the Upper Columbia River \\nand the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway based on the concentrations of hazardous substances in soil.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 18  The Site description presented in the HRS documentation record at proposal was intended to describe the Site \\nbased on the information used to complete the HRS scoring of the Site. Page 1 of the HRS documentation record \\nat proposal elaborated on the location and description of the Site explaining that, “[t] he street address, \\ncoordinates, and contaminant locations.… represent one or more locations EPA considers to be part of the site \\nbased on the screening information EPA used to evaluate the site for Nationa l Priorities List (NPL) listing.” The \\ndescription of the Site in the HRS documentation record was also not a final determination of what composes the \\nentire Site, because, as also explained on page 1, “HRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release merely \\nrepresent the initial determination that a certain area may need to be addressed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). ” Regardless of prior descriptions of the \\ncontamination, the subject of this rule making  is the evaluation of the Site for HRS scoring purposes, which is the \\nSite as described in the HRS documentation record at proposal and which meets the HRS definition of a site.   \\nThe Site was properly described  and defined in the HRS documentation record at proposal , consistent with the  \\nHRS.  For HRS purposes, a site is defined in HRS Section 1.1, Definitions, as: \\n  \\nArea(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has \\notherwise come to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area \\nbetween sources.  \\n Page 1 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated that the “EPA lists national priorities among the \\nknown ‘releases or threatened releases’ of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely delineated boundaries.” Page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal described the specific Site and \\nstated that it: \\n \\nincludes for HRS scoring purposes the release of metals from two smelters to the UCR and to soil. The Upper Columbia River site includes three sources: slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter, currently owned by Teck Metals Ltd. (Teck; also referred to \\nin references as Teck American Incorporated [TAI]), to the UCR approximately 10 river miles \\n(RMs) upstream of the international border in Trail, British Columbia (B.C.); and two sources \\n(i.e., contaminated soil and sluice box discharge) associated with the former Le Roi smelter \\nlocated in Northport, Washington.\\n \\n \\nThis description of the Site meets the criteria of a site as defined by the HRS  and adequately describes the \\ncontamination as evaluated in the HRS documentation record at proposal.   \\nAs these comments relate to the communication between the EPA and the public, please see section 3.2, Community Involvement, of this support document for a discussion of comments questioning the level of communication with \\nthe public.  \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.5 Extent of Site \\nComment : Several commenters submitted comments questioning the extent of the proposed Site. Five citizens \\nstated that the Site is too extensive, asserting that the Site should be more specific. One other citizen asserted that the extent of the Site should be reduced and should not include the entire 150 miles of the Upper Columbia River from the U.S.-Canada border to the Grand Coulee Dam. Three  citizens commented that the extent of the proposed \\nSite is inappropriate due to insufficient data to support the d esignation.  \\n \\nTAI, Stevens County, and the Lincoln County Commissioners (Lincoln County) provided comments discussing \\nwhether contamination is present in specific areas. TAI asserted that if placed on the NPL, the Site should be Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 19  limited to the Le Roi/Northport smelter facility. In discussing the ongoing investigations, Lincoln County \\ncommented that “[n]othing of significance has arisen in the lower parts of the lake, all the way to  \\nGrand Coulee Dam.” Stevens County stated that it disagreed that unidentified properties may require remediation.   \\nResponse: The determination of the extent of the Site for HRS scoring purposes was appropriately established and \\ndescribed in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The full extent of site-related contamination, however, is not determined at the listing stage o f the CERCLA  process. The Site  boundaries may change  pending the results \\nof further investigation into where the contamination has come to be located. Placing\\n a site on the NPL is based \\non an evaluation, in accordance with the HRS, of a release or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. However, the fact that the EPA initially identifies and lists the release based on a \\nreview of contamination at a certain parcel of property (or area) does not necessarily mean that the site boundaries \\nare limited to that parcel (or area).  \\n CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(A) requires the EPA to list national priorities among the known “releases or \\nthreatened releases” of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely delineated boundaries. \\nFurther, CERCLA Section 101(a) defin es a “facility” as the “site” where a hazardous substance has been \\n“deposited, stored, placed, or otherwise come to be located.” The “come to be located” language gives the EPA \\nbroad authority to clean up contamination when it has spread from the original source. On March 31, 1989 (54 FR \\n13298), the EPA stated: \\n \\nHRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release merely represent the initial  determination that \\na certain area may need to be addressed under CERCLA. Accordingly, EPA contemplates that the preliminary description of facility boundaries at the time of scoring will need to be refined and \\nimproved as more information is developed as to where the contamination has come to be \\nlocated; this refining step generally comes during the RI/FS stage. [emphasis added] \\n The revised HRS (55 FR 51587, December 14, 1990) elaborates on the “come to be located” language, defining \\n“site” as “area(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has otherwise \\ncome to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area between the sources.”  \\n Until the site investigation process has been completed and a remedial action (if any) selected, the  EPA can \\nneither estimate the extent of contamination at the NPL site, nor describe the ultimate dimensions of the site. Even \\nduring a remedial action (e.g., the removal of buried waste) the EPA may find that the contamination has spread \\nfurther than previously estimated, and the site definition may be correspondingly expanded.  \\n \\nRegarding specific locations with contamination, the Site was defined in the HRS documentation record at proposal based on locations where hazardous substances were located consistent  with the HRS definition of a site. \\nPage 1 of the HRS documentation record at proposal explained that the:  \\n \\ncontaminant locations presented in this Hazard Ranking System (HRS) documentation record identify the general area the site is located. They represent one or more locations EPA considers \\nto be part of the site based on the screening information EPA used to evaluate the site for \\nNational Priorities List (NPL) listing . \\n \\nIn describing the specifics of the Site being scored, page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated \\nthat the Site includes, “ the release of metals from two smelters to the UCR and to soil ” and “three sources.” This \\npage continued that the three sources include:  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 20  slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter  … to the UCR approximately \\n10 river miles (RMs) upstream of the international border in Trail, British Columbia (B.C.); and \\ntwo sources (i.e., contaminated soil and sluice box discharge) associated with the former Le Roi \\nsmelter . \\n \\nPage 14 indicated that the three sources “have been documented to contain metals, including antimony, arsenic, \\ncadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver, zinc, and mercury.” The HRS documentation record at proposal \\nexplained where the contamination is located (in surface water sediments in the Upper Columbia River and in \\nnearby soil) and the specific hazardous substances in the contamination being evaluated. Accordingly, the HRS documentation record at proposal sufficiently identified the extent of the Site f or the purpose of HRS scoring and \\nNPL placement. See also section 3.4, Site Description and Definition, of this support document, for further discussion of the Site description.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.6 Comingled Contamination  \\nComment : TAI commented that inclusion of the Northport area as part of the Site is inappropriate and \\ninconsistent with historical treatment of that area as a separate site. TAI asserted that the EPA’s public \\ncommunications have focused on the soil contamination i n the Northport area which is a separate site unrelated to \\nthe Cominco  smelter. TAI stated that it disagreed with the inclusion of two separate sites as part of the Upper \\nColumbia River site for NPL designation purposes. TAI distinguished the two, s tating that “ the Upper Columbia \\nRiver/Lake Roosevelt Site surrounds the town of Northport, Washington, located approximately 7 river miles downstream of the U.S.- Canada border.” It asserted that Northport has been treated as a separate site in other \\ninstances, such as the exclusion of the Northport area fro m the  RI/FS residential sampling. TAI commented that \\nthe scoring approach used could cause “confusion around what ‘the site’ it aims to list actually is.” TAI disagreed with the scoring of the Site based on comingled contamination, stating: \\n \\nEPA has discretion to score different portions of a site: EPA guidance11 indicates that when \\nmultiple sources are in an area, the EPA Regional Office must decide whether to treat the area as \\none site or as several sites for HRS scoring purposes.6 EPA Region 10 now apparently considers \\nNorthport part of the Upper Columbia River/Lake Roosevelt Site, on the basis that emissions from the Trail smelter 20 miles away have “commingled” with contamination from the former Le \\nRoi/Northport smelter. TAI disa grees with this assertion based on extensive work done as part of \\nthe RI/FS, which shows that, as expected, the material impact of aerial emissions from the Trail \\nsmelter are localized around the smelter in British Columbia and a few miles into Washington .\\n12 \\n[61, 61a, 62] \\n \\nResponse : The HRS documentation record at proposal appropriately evaluated the Site as the comingled \\ncontamination from historical releases associated with the Cominco and Le Roi smelters. While the Site is the comingled contamination from releases from the two smelters, the HRS documentation record at proposal also \\ndocumented that both releases associated with Cominco and Le Roi smelters would independently achieve an \\nNPL qualifying HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately (see Appendix A of the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal). These independent releases from the two smelters comingled in surface water \\nand via air deposition to soil. (See pages 14, 77-78, and 96- 97 of the HRS documentation record at proposal.) \\nTherefore, listing this Site as presented in the HRS documentation record at proposal is consistent with the intent \\n \\n11 TAI cited page 39 of the HRS Guidance Manual.  \\n12 TAI points to TAI, Upper Columbia River Draft Final Remedial Investigation Report for OU 3.

Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 21  of CERCLA as it evaluates the overlapping threat posed by the comingled releases from the former smelter \\noperations.  \\n \\nIn discussing the function of the NPL, CERCLA Section 105 (a)(8)(B) (as modified by SARA) directs the establishment of the NPL:  \\n \\nBased upon the criteria set forth in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the President shall list as \\npart of the plan national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases throughout the \\nUnited States,... In assembling or revising the nationa l list, the President shall consider any \\npriorities established by the states. To the extent practicable, [at least four hundred of] the highest \\npriority facilities shall be designated individually and shall be referred to as the “top priority \\namong known response targets”  \\n Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the National Contingency Plan (NCP) \\ninclude: \\n  \\n[C]riteria  for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United \\nStates for the purpose of taking remedial action and, to the extent practicable, take into account the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action.  \\n To direct implementation of CERCLA (and SARA), the EPA revised the NCP (40 CFR part 300). Section 300.5, Definitions, of the NCP lists the definitions in CERCLA and adds others. It defines the National Priorities List as:  \\n \\nNational Priorities List (NPL) means the list, compiled by EPA pursuant to CERCLA section \\n105, of uncontrolled hazardous substance releases that are priorities for long- term remedial \\nevaluation and response.  \\n \\nThe HRS definition of a site is centered on where contamination has come to be located and may include consideration of more than one area. HRS Section 1.1, Definitions , provides the definition for a site and directs \\nthat a site can include multiple areas. The HRS defines the term site\\n as: \\n \\nArea(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has \\notherwise come to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area \\nbetween sources.  \\n \\nHence, the focus of the listing is on the release and the EPA has scored the overall comingled release from the \\ntwo smelters based on information available for a complete HRS evaluation. In addition, the EPA provided a \\nsupplemental scoring in the HRS documentation record at proposal in Appendix A showing each smelter’s release \\nwould achieve an HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately .  \\n As explained throughout the HRS documentation record at proposal, the Site is the release of metals from the two \\nsmelters ( Cominco  and Le Roi) to the Upper Columbia River and to soil : \\n  \\n• The Site Summary section on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed that the Site includes for HRS scoring purposes the release of metals from two smelters to the Upper Columbia \\nRiver and to soil . It identified that releases from the three scored sources (Cominco slag discharges, Le \\nRoi sluice box discharges, and contaminated soil at the former Le Roi facility) have resulted in comingled \\ncontamination in the Upper Columbia River. It also identified aerial deposition released from both \\nsmelters has become comingled in the AOC soil contamination.  \\n• The Attribution section for the surface water migration pathway on pages 77-78 of the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal discussed the nearly continuous contamination in the 35- mile stretch of Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 22  the river encompassing the zone of contamination scored, and the comingling of the two smelters’ \\nreleases to surface water at and downstream of the Le Roi smelter.  \\n• The Attribution section for the soil exposure component on pages 96-97 of the HRS documentation \\nrecord  at proposal discussed airborne emissions from the two smelters, including operations/emissions \\nfrom Le Roi and air quality/deposition modeling and analysis for emissions from the Cominco smelter to \\nthe greater Upper Columbia River Basin over an 85- year period.  \\n The inclusion  of the Northport area within the scope of  the S ite in the NPL listing is appropriate. The EPA \\nconducted a removal site evaluation of the Le Roi s melter  in 2003 and a removal action in 2004. The RI/FS work \\ndid not begin until after the removal action at Le Roi s melter  began. Thus, the  Le Roi smelter location of the  2003 \\nremoval action was, at that time, considered a separate site. The purpose of the RI/FS for the Upper Columbia \\nRiver site is to determine the nature and extent of contamination, which includes the Le Roi smelter . In 2015, T AI \\ndisputed a direction from  the EPA and, as part of the dispute resolution, the EPA agreed to reduce the area of soil \\nsampling T AI was required to do. The EPA did not require T AI to sample in the Northport town proper in 2016. \\nHowever, the EPA did not exclude Northport from any future sampling or  response action s. \\n As noted above, both the Cominco and Le Roi smelter  releases would independently achieve an NPL qualifying \\nHRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately. While both smelters independently achieve an NPL \\neligible HRS site score, the threat to the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure and subsurface \\nintrusion pathway is the result of comingled releases from the operations at the smelters.   \\n TAI’s claim that aerial emissions from the Cominco smelter are localized around the smelter in British Columbia \\nand a few miles into Washington is incorrect . TAI cites its October 2023 Upper Columbia River Draft Final \\nRemedial Investigation Report for OU 3 as the  basis for  these statements. The EPA disapproved this report on \\nApril 9, 2024, for multiple reasons includ ing TAI ’s mistaken assertions concerning  the geographic limitation of \\naerial metals emissions from the Cominco  smelter.  The full extent of the upland soil contamination is not known, \\nand the EPA is pursuing further investigations.   \\nFinally, even if the comingling of Cominco/Le Roi releases in contamination in the soil at Northport were not \\nconsidered and the soil exposure component were not scored, the Site would still achieve an NPL- qualifying HRS \\nsite score of 28.50 or greater base d solely on the comingled surface water contamination and the surface water \\nmigration pathway score (i.e., the surface water migration pathway yields a pathway score of 100.00, which would result by itself in a site score of 50.00).  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.7 Liability \\nComment: TAI, Stevens County, and two citizens commented on the presence of PRPs and/or liability for the \\ncontamination scored. TAI commented that some of the upland soil contamination along the Upper Columbia \\nRiver is related to impacts from the Le Roi/Northport  smelter and unrelated to the Cominco  smelter and Teck. \\nTAI asserted that as the release associated with the Le/Roi Smelter lacks a solvent PRP, the Site should be limited to the impacts from the Le Roi smelter. TAI commented that following the Settlement Agreement, Teck has made \\ncontinual progress on the RI/FS. Stevens County stated that a PRP is not present for the residential soil \\ncontamination around Northport. Additionally, two citizens commented that involvement from Canada is needed to address the issue as contamination is coming from Canada.  \\n \\nResponse : The NPL listing process is separate from a determination of liability, and liability is not considered in \\nevaluating a site under the HRS. The NPL serves primarily as an informational tool for use by the EPA in identifying those sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health or the environment. Listing a site on \\nthe NPL does not reflect a judgment on the activities of the owner(s) or operator(s) of a site. It does not require Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 23  those persons to undertake any action, nor does it assign any liability to any person. This position, stated in the \\nlegislative history of CERCLA, has been explained more fully in the Federal Register  (48 FR 40674, September \\n8, 1983, and 53 FR 23988, June 24, 1988). See Kent County v. EPA, 963 F.2d 391 (D.C. Cir. 1992  Furthermore, the presence or absence of a PRP (solvent or otherwise) or the absence of involvement from other \\nparties are not factors considered in determining whether to place a site on the NPL . Evaluating whether this Site \\nis eligible for proposal to the NPL is based on the technical analysis set forth in the HRS and explained in the HRS documentation record at proposal. Comments about funding for site remediation are addressed in section \\n3.8, Funding, of this support document.  \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.8 Funding \\nComment: TAI, Stevens County, Benton County, and several citizens submitted comments discussing sources and \\nuses of funding for remedial work.  \\n \\nTAI commented that an RI/FS is ongoing and fully funded. TAI asserted that if NPL designation is pursued, then \\nthe Site should be limited to the Le Roi/Northport smelter due to its lack of a solvent PRP.   \\nTAI asserted that while the EPA’s news release about the proposed addition of the Site to the NPL suggested that \\nNPL placement allows the EPA access to funding via the Superfund program, the process of NPL designation \\nonly makes non- federal sites eligible for federal funding, and that NPL listing makes sites eligible for this funding \\nbut does not guarantee it. TAI commented that: \\n \\n• Only non-federal sites are eligible for funding via the Superfund program following placement on the \\nNPL.  \\n• Other funding mechanisms are required to be pursued by the NCP prior financing remedial actions via the Superfund.  \\n• Actual funding via the Superfund program is determined through specific prioritization factors. \\n• This Site is unlikely to be prioritized for funding due to the limited risk posed by the Site compared other sites.  \\n• Funding, if awarded, may not be immediately available.  \\n \\nStevens County, Benton County, and five  citizens asserted that the motivation behind the pursuit of an NPL \\ndesignation for the Site is to obtain funding. Stevens County stated that it disagreed that adding the entire area to the NPL would result in funding for remedial actions. Stevens County st ated that “references to tapping into IIJA \\n[Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ] dollars” for this Site have been made. Five citizens asserted that \\nincluding this Site on the NPL would be an inappropriate use of tax dollars. One citizen commented that funding should be in the form of grants to allow the community to make improvements that will work at a local level. Five \\ncitizens commented that political power associated with funding is another motivation behind the placement of the Site on the NPL. One citizen asserted that placing the Site on the NPL could become a major cost to \\ntaxpayers. Benton County asserted that the idea that NPL listing will lead to cleanup funding is flawed because it \\nis based on the assumption that public health/environmental concerns will be identified (which is inconsistent \\nwith RI/FS findings so far).  \\n \\nResponse: Insomuch as these comments are related to sources of funding for future or ongoing remedial activities, \\nsources of funding for remedial activities are not a factor considered in evaluating whether the NPL placement of a site is warranted. The costs associated with future or ongoing remedial actions are not determined as part of the Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 24  listing stage of the CERCLA process. The discussion of costs in NPL rules in the Federal Register  clearly states \\nthat including a site on the NPL does not cause the EPA necessarily to undertake remedial action; it does not \\nrequire any action by a private party, nor does it assign liability for site response costs (56 FR 21462, May 9, \\n1991). The cost discussion outlines the EPA’s perception of average potential costs per site that may occur in association with events generally following the proposed listing of a site. Any EPA actions that may impose costs \\non entitie s are based on discretionary decisions and are made on a case-by- case basis. Also, responsible parties \\nmay bear some or all the costs of the RI/FS and subsequent work, or the costs may be shared by the EPA and the \\nStates. Therefore, expenditures cited by the commenter are associated with events that generally follow  listing the \\nsite, not with the listing itself. The EPA has not allocated costs for this Site at this time.   \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.9 Economic Impact and Stigma of Listing \\nComment : Stevens County, Lincoln County, SCBID , QCBID , ECBID , and 21 citizens expressed concern \\nregarding potential economic impacts to the region. In discussing possible economic impacts, Stevens County, QCBID, SCBID, ECBID, and 10 citizens expressed concern for one or more of the following:  \\n \\n• Possible decreases in property values  \\n• Possible changes in taxation and/or shifting tax burdens  \\n• Negative impacts to local business  \\n• Decreases in local tourism and/or local recreation  \\n• Impacts to agriculture and/or global trade markets for food products  \\n The SCBID, QCBID, ECBID, and one citizen also stated that because local farms irrigate crops with water from \\nthe Columbia River, crops from the region may be stigmatized resulting in negative economic impacts to \\nagriculture businesses. The SCBID, QCBID, and ECBID also asserted that the resulting decreases to agriculture businesses could cascade and affect national food supply and/or global trade markets.  \\n \\nIn addition, four citizens commented that economic concerns could occur, asserting  previous economic impacts \\nhave occurred to the local industry (e.g., logging) because  of the protection of the spotted owl as an endangered \\nspecies.  \\n \\nResponse: The EPA notes that there are both costs and benefits that can be associated with listing a site. The \\npotential stigma and economic impacts identified by the commenters, however, are not considered in the \\nassessment of whether a site belongs on the NPL. Such impacts are not the result of NPL listing. Instead, potential negative impacts associated with listing the Site, as noted by the commenter, would be engendered by the \\ncontamination in the area, not by placing the Site on the NPL. Furthermore, inclusion of a site or facility on the \\nNPL reflects the EPA’s judgment that a significant release or threat of release has occurred and that the site is a \\npriority for further investigation under CERCLA.  \\n Among the benefits associated with listing a site are increased health and environmental protection as a result of \\nincreased public awareness of potential hazards. In addition to the potential for federally financed remedial actions, the addition of a site to the NPL could accelerate privately financed, v oluntary cleanup efforts. Listing \\nsites as national priority targets also can give States increased support for funding responses at particular sites. As \\na result of the additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower human exposure to high- risk chemicals, and \\naccess to higher quality surface water, groundwater , soil , and air . Therefore, it is possible that any perceived or \\nactual negative fluctuations in property values, stigma, or development opportunities that may result from \\ncontamination may also be countered by positive fluctuations when a CERCLA investigation and any ne cessary \\ncleanup are completed. For further information, see information in the September 2000 EPA fact sheet, Superfund Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 25  Today, How Can a Superfund Site Affect My Property? (EPA 540 -F-98-001, available at \\nhttps://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/927384.pdf ).  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  \\n3.10 Purpose of Listing \\nComment: TAI, Stevens County, Lincoln County, QCBID, SCBID, ECBID, the Rimrock Cabin Owners \\nAssociation, and several citizens submitted comments discussing the purpose and rationale for listing.  \\n \\nPurpose of NPL Listing  \\nTAI requested that the purpose of listing be clarified, including the benefits and limitations. TAI asserted that \\nstatements have been made that incorrectly suggest that additional enforcement authority is provided via NPL \\nplacement and that these types of  statements provide misinformation about the status of a proposed NPL site. TAI \\ncommented that NPL designation does not provide additional enforcement authority. TAI commented that a Washington State Department of Ecology staff member made a statement sugg esting that an NPL designation for \\nthe Site would end an ongoing litigation.\\n13  \\n \\nTAI stated that an RI/FS is ongoing for this Site in contrast to most sites, which are typically considered for NPL placement at the preliminary assessment (PA) stage. TAI commented that HRS scoring is a site evaluation process \\nintended “for a relatively q uick, limited assessment based on high- level data available in the early days of \\nunderstanding the site.” It asserted that HRS scoring is not intended to account for extensive site- specific data. \\nTAI stated that the HRS Guidance Manual notes that HRS score s are intended to reflect the threat at the time of \\nscoring. TAI commented that the ongoing RI/FS will determine the need for remedial action and the specific \\nactions necessary.  \\n Need for Listing  \\nSeveral commenters provided comments discussing whether a need for listing the Site on the NPL had been established. F ive citizens commented that a need for the proposed NPL designation of the Site had not been \\nprovided. In discussing results of prior investigations, Lincoln County commented that no significant issues have \\nbeen found for lower parts of Lake Roosevelt to the Grand Coulee Dam. A citizen commented that it is unclear \\nwhat remediation of the Site will accomplish.  Three citizens asserted that the designation appeared to be \\nmotivated by the pursuit of funding. Three citizens also commented that a Superfund designation will shift \\npolitical power over a large part of Eastern Washington to the State and local tribes. A citizen asserted that \\nwithout coordination with the Government of Canada, the issue of contamination in the Upper Columbia River \\nwill remain. The QCBID, SCBID, and ECBID asserted that alternative approaches to remediate the soil \\ncontamination that are being identified in the RI/FS should  be pursued. Lincoln County commented that \\nalternatives should be pursued to address issues identified in the lower portion of Lake Roosevelt.   Stevens County asserted that NPL placement of the Site is premature and the process of completing the RI/FS \\nprior to placing the Site on the NPL should be followed. Stevens County commented that the process should also \\nbe followed because the new EPA guida nce on lead levels in soil is inconsistent with the screening levels for \\nmetals in Washington state. Stevens County asserted that placing the Site on the NPL at this time would eliminate the determination of whether remedial work would exacerbate the threat to human health and public safety. It also \\ncommented that NPL placement at this stage would eliminate the examination of which remedial methods are \\nmost appropriate.  \\n \\n \\n13 TAI points to statements made by Brook Beeler, Eastern Regional Manager at the Washington State Department of \\nEcology, as shown in an article from the Roll Call newspaper, available at https://rollcall.com/2024/04/10/superfund- plan-\\nfor-columbia -river -sparks -debate- in-northwest/ .  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 26  One citizen commented that other areas may be in a greater need of remediation and funding for remediation. \\nAnother citizen asserted that listing would cause adverse public health impacts as a result of an economic \\ndownturn.  \\n Remedy Decision/ Remedial Actions  \\nThe Rimrock Cabin Owners Association and 14 citizens submitted comments providing suggested remedial actions. These concerns about future remediation from the Rimrock Cabin Owners Association and the citizens \\nincluded comments that:  \\n \\n• Remediation of the sediment in the Columbia River could lead to a greater exposure to contamination if sediment is disturbed.  \\n• Additional unbiased testing to determine high levels of contamination should occur before remediation begins.  \\n• Documentation that the proposed remedial work will result in improved conditions should be required.  \\n• Unique solutions for remediation and additional planning should be considered.  \\n• Smelters should be shut down and modified.  \\n• Instead of removing the dam, adding fish ladders is a more appropriate mitigation approach and will not impact agriculture in the area.  \\n• Remedial work should be focused on a specific area as opposed to a broader geographic area.  \\n• Remedial work could negatively impact the lake and river area.  \\n• Cleanup should be completed on an area-specific basis accounting for the risk to human health or \\nwildlife.  \\n \\nResponse : The purpose of listing a site on the NPL is to inform the public of a possible threat posed by a site that \\nwarrants further investigation. The EPA’s actions to evaluate the Upper Columbia River site using the HRS and \\nlisting the Site are consistent with the requirements of CERCLA and SARA, and the statutory purpose of the \\nNPL.  \\n \\nPlacing the Site on the NPL is not an announcement of any site- specific risk level or a determination of the need \\nfor remedial action. Listing a site reflects the EPA’s decision to inform the public of the possible threat posed by the site and at a later stage in the CERCLA  process the EPA will determine what, or if, cleanup  action is \\nwarranted. An HRS site score above 28.50 for the Upper Columbia River site represents the EPA’s determination that the Site poses a relative risk as compared to other sites evaluated under the HRS and that the Site warrants further investigation  and potential remediation. At this Site, hazardous substances, including antimony, arsenic, \\ncadmium, chromium, copper, lead, zinc, and mercury, were identified in a release to surface water, and lead and arsenic were identified in contaminated soil ; the relative risk posed by this contamination is reflected in the HRS \\nscoring of the surface water migration pathway and soil exposure component in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The contamination documented in sediments and surface soil has the potential to affect human health \\nand/or the environment. The need for remedial action to address the sediment and soil contamination will be assessed during later stages of the CERCLA process.  \\n \\nPurpose of NPL Listing  \\nThe NPL is generally intended to be a “rough list” of prioritized hazardous sites; a “first step in a process —\\nnothing more, nothing less.” Eagle Picher Indus. v. EPA, 759 F.2d 922, 932 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Eagle Picher II). \\nThe HRS is the mechanism used to evaluate the relative risk of a site. If a site scores 28.50 or greater using the HRS, then it may be added to the NPL.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 27  The purpose of NPL listing is explained in the Federal Register  Notice of February 21, 1990 (Volume 55, \\nNumber 35), excerpted below:  \\n \\nThe purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informational and management \\ntool. The initial identification of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide EPA in \\ndetermining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of the public \\nhealth and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA -financed \\nremedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of si tes \\nEPA believes warrant further investigation.  \\n \\nAddition of the Site to the NPL thus indicates further investigation is warranted to fully assess the extent of risk \\nposed by the Site (and remedial actions may be selected based on the findings of that complete assessment).  \\n Need  for Listing  \\nSufficient basis for placing the Site on the NPL has been established. The Site qualifies for addition to the NPL because it has achieved an HRS score equal to or greater than 28.50, as is demonstrated in the HRS documentation record and this support document. Achieving a site score of 28.50 or greater indicates that the Site  \\nis eligible for inclusion on the NPL and therefore warrants further investigation. Placing a site on the NPL allows the EPA to more effectively prioritize sites and manage possible fut ure site investigations  and response actions; it \\nalso notifies the public that the release at a site is of concern to the Agency. The HRS score for the Site is based on the release of contamination documented in sediment s in the surface water migration pathway and soil \\ncontamination in the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, the \\ncontaminants present, and the targets subject to actual and potential contamination, consistent with th e HRS. The \\nHRS site score above 28.50 presents sufficient need for NPL placement and establishes that the Site poses sufficient relative risk to warrant further investigation.  As explained in detail in section 3.15, Risk to Human \\nHealth and the Environment, of this support document, the HRS evaluation of a site is not a risk assessment and \\nnot intended to provide a specific determination of risk. Rather, the specific risk posed by the Site is determined at \\na separate stage in the CERCLA  process.  \\n Remedy Decision/ Remedial Actions  \\nPlacement of a site on the NPL is not an evaluation of the effectiveness of any remedy currently in place or a \\ndetermination of whether specific remedial actions are appropriate. T he EPA has a procedure for identifying sites \\nwhere releases of substances addressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the \\nNPL, evaluating the nature and extent of the threats at such sites, responding to those threats, and deleting sites \\nfrom the NPL.  The evaluation, or RI/FS phase, involves on- site testing to assess the nature and extent of the \\npublic health and environmental risks associated with the site, and provides information to determine what \\nremedial actions, if any, may be appropriate. After a period of public comment, the EPA responds to those threats \\nby issuing a Record of Decision that selects the most appropriate alternative. The selected remedy is implemented \\nduring the remedial design/remedial action phase. Finally, the site may be  deleted from the NPL when the EPA \\ndetermines that no furt her response is appropriate.  \\n \\nWhile the steps in the CERCLA  process are distinct, they can be conducted in parallel. For the Upper Columbia \\nRiver site, the Site was evaluated using the HRS and received an HRS site score of 51.15, which exceeds the \\nthreshold for placement on the NPL. Because of an NPL eligible HRS site score, in conjunct ion with concurrence \\nfrom the state of Washington , the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation,  and The Spokane Tribe of \\nIndians , the EPA proposed the Site for listing on the NPL. Prior to proposi ng the Site on the NPL, to address the \\nSite in a more timely manner, the EPA has been overseeing the conduct of an RI/FS by a PRP to evaluate the Site \\nin more depth to characterize site contamination and to analyze interim remedial alternatives to address the most \\npressing threats at the Site. The EPA has also conducted or overseen implementation of time critical removal Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 28  actions to address immediate threats to public health.14 As a matter of policy, however, the EPA does not delay \\nNPL listing of a site to incorporate any new data or to score new pathways if the ultimate listing decision is not \\naffected.  \\n \\nAs previously noted in this support document, the selection of remedy—if any is found necessary  for some or all \\nof the Site —and any associated funding is a step carried out at a later stage of the CERCLA  process.  Thus, \\ncomments on a remedy are premature at the listing stage.  However, placing the Site on the NPL does not prohibit \\nany PRP or stakeholder from participating in cleanup efforts  as discussed in detail in section 3.14, Ongoing \\nInvestigation and Remediation, of this support document. The ongoing RI/FS is also discussed further in that \\nsection.  \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.11 Due Process  \\nComment: Stevens County stated that information has been delayed or withheld to move forward with the listing \\nprocess. Stevens County asserted that comments were solicited from select groups on the draft BERA, which is used to support some aspects of the NPL proposal of the Site. It commented that Citizens for Clean Columbia \\nwere provided an opportunity to comment prior to the release of the draft document, while local governments \\nwere not given the same opportunity to comment.  \\n Stevens County also stated that the “solicitation of clean up action contracting for this process under the CERCLA \\nprogram and NPL”\\n15 prior to the proposal to list the Site on the NPL suggests that “this rule- making process has a \\npredetermined outcome without affording the process follow all federal guidelines.” Stevens County quoted the \\nsolicitation, which, in part, states: \\n \\nR10 Upper Columbia River Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7, Acquisition Management Branch, is seeking \\nthe services of an experienced firm to provide Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support services within the Upper Columbia River (UCR) Site. The primary focus of this requirement will \\nbe on residential properties within the Town of Northport that are affected by commingled \\ncontamination from smelter operations.… To achieve this, work includes: 1) an additional round \\nof voluntary soil sampling at properties that have not been previously sampled; 2) complete a \\nremoval assessment and prioritization of properties for cleanup using data obtained during the \\ncurrent and previous sampling events; and 3) conduct time critical removal actions (TCRA) at the \\nproperties identified for cleanup. [A12]  \\n \\nResponse: The EPA correctly followed the HRS, complied with the requirements in the APA, and followed \\nrelevant procedures in determining whether to list  the Site on the NPL. The EPA has concluded that placing the \\nSite on the NPL is an appropriate step in the multi- step CERCLA process.  \\n \\nConsistent with CERCLA, the EPA has in place a procedure for identifying sites where releases of substances \\naddressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the NPL, evaluating the nature and \\nextent of the threats at such sites, res ponding to those threats, and deleting sites from the NPL. The purpose of the \\ninitial two steps is to develop the NPL, which identifies for the States and the public those sites that appear to \\n \\n14 See the Upper Columbia River Study Area webpage ( https://www.epa.gov/columbiariver/upper -columbia -river -study -area) \\ndiscussion in the section titled “Residential cleanups” (as well as planning for future actions in the section “ EPA to conduct \\ntime-critical removal/soil cleanup action ”). \\n15 Stevens County point ed to a solicitation located at: \\nhttps://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2ffedconnect%3fdoc%3d68HE0724R0014%26agency%3\\ndEPA&doc=68HE0724R0014&agency=EPA   Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 29  warrant remedial action (56 FR 35842, July 29, 1991). The evaluation or RI/FS phase involves on- site testing to \\nassess the nature and extent of the public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine \\nwhat alternatives for remedi al action, if any, may be appropriate. After a period of public comment following \\nissuance of the RI/FS and the identification of a preferred alternative, the EPA responds to the identified threats \\nby issuing a Record of Decision which selects the most appropriate alternative. The selected remedy is \\nimplemented during the remedial design/remedial action phase. Finally, the site may be deleted from the NPL \\nwhen the EPA determines that no further response is appropriate.   \\n This process encourages and relies on the participation of the public, including PRPs. The public can comment \\nduring the comment period (typically 60 days) after a site is proposed for listing and during the time the EPA is \\nevaluating and selecting a remed y (the EPA may also hold a public hearing during the latter decision- making \\nperiod). If private parties conduct a remedial action under a consent decree between the EPA and the parties, the \\ndecree is also subject to public comment. The EPA believes that th e above process offers the public sufficient \\nopportunity to present facts and opinions germane to its decision- making.   \\n \\nAdditionally, the CERCLA  process allows the Agency to include expedited removal actions and interim measures \\nto address more immediate concerns or address portions of a site. The EPA may select removal actions (such as a \\nTCRA) at any time to address immediate risks to human health. (See CERCLA Section 10 4.) \\n \\nAs further detailed in section 3.3, Adequacy of Documentation, of this support document, on the subject of the \\nBERA , whether the BERA forms part of the basis for listing and the lack of opportunity for local governments to \\ncomment on the BERA, the HRS evaluation and HRS site score is fully supported by the references in the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal , and the draft BERA is not needed to support the HRS score. The public was \\nprovided a 60- day comment period to review and comment on all documents supporting the listing decision,  \\nincluding the HRS documentation record at proposal and supporting references. The BERA was not included as a  \\nreference to the HRS documentation record at proposal  and is not needed to support the HRS score. Whether \\nanother group may have had an opportunity to evaluate a document not relied upon for the proposed listing of the Site is unrelated to the present listing action.  \\n Regarding the solicitation identified by the commenter (“solicitation of clean up action”), the solicitation \\nsummary quoted above is looking for services to complete Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support \\nservices. Removal action support services can occur separately and be unrelated to the evaluation of whether \\nplacing a site on the NPL is appropriate. As identified in the HRS documentation record at proposal, removal \\nactions have been conducted to address soil contamination in and around the Northport area. The volume of \\ncontaminated soil removed at those locations was not included in the Site for HRS scoring purposes.  Page 92 of \\nthe HRS documentation record at proposal explained that the “EPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area dating back to 2003,” and for the evaluation of “the hazardous waste quantity area \\nand resident population for the AOC … only contaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did \\nnot have soil removals, were included in the calculation.” Thus, this solicitation is unrelated to the HRS \\ndocumentation record and does not impact the site score or affect the assessment of whether placement on the \\nNPL is appropriate.  Note that NPL listing allows for  CERCLA remedial action, which is different from a removal \\naction (i.e., as set out in 42 U.S.C. § 9601(24), a remedial action is generally considered to include those actions \\ntaken that are consistent with a permanent remedy ); also, CERCLA removal actions may occur at any time on \\nsites that are either on , or not on, the NPL.   \\n The solicitation  referred to by the commenter  was issued to ensure that contract services are in place to support \\nadditional removal site evaluation and removal actions , should they be determined to be necessary, at properties \\nwhere potential immediate  risk exists.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 30  3.12 Delay Listing Until the RI/FS is Completed \\nComment: Stevens County, the Eastern Washington Council of Governments (EWCOG), Lincoln County, \\nQCBID, SCBID, ECBID, Benton County, and 22  citizens stated that placement of the Site on the NPL should not \\noccur prior to the completion of an RI/FS or other similar investigation. Stevens County and one  citizen \\ncommented that the EPA previously stated that the Site would not be placed on the NPL until after the RI/FS is \\ncompleted. One citizen asserted that the 2006 settlement agreement with Teck mandated certain studies be completed before NPL listing . [C15] EWCOG stated that, as a high concern is not present, delaying listing “will \\nnot have a detrimental effect.”  \\n \\nStevens County asserted that the RI/FS is ongoing, would be complete in a few years, and should be completed as \\nsoon as possible. Stevens County stated that placing the Site on the NPL after the RI/FS would:  \\n• Ensure “ reliable science- based studies to confirm there is/was an issue needing clean up”  \\n• Identify “specific areas for clean -up where the cleanup action would not create more harm than benefit”  \\n \\nStevens County and several  citizens submitted comments discussing whether the Site should be placed on the \\nNPL prior to the collection of data and information from additional reports. Eight citizens stated that it is unclear \\nwhy NPL designation is occurring without the scientific data that would result from the RI/FS. Stevens County commented that  it is unclear why NPL designation is being pursued for the entire waterbody as an EPA \\nrepresentative indicated that Lake Roosevelt meets drinking water standards except for bacteria, which have not been tested for. Stevens County asserted that pursuing listing prior to completion of the RI/FS would eliminate the \\nassessment of whether remedial efforts may have negative effects and identifying which cleanup methods are \\nappropriate. Stevens County commented that an FS needs to be completed to limit exposure during cleanup. \\nStevens County stated that the RI/FS investigation for ecologic health is funded and that completed human health \\nstudies are indicating no actions a re needed. One citizen commented that the RI/FS will provide information about \\nthe best remedial approach.  \\n \\nIn a letter provided to the EPA included as Attachment A to its comment submission, Stevens County requested \\nthat NPL listing be reconsidered. Stevens County also stated that if the EPA were to pursue an “NPL Listing \\n(Superfund Designation) without completing the RI/FS studies first, you leave us with no other option but to challenge your actions in court.”  \\n \\nResponse : There is no need to delay NPL listing to wait for the results of the RI/FS investigation.  All site \\ninvestigation work performed  to date or currently proceeding, including the ongoing RI/FS, will be considered in \\nsubsequent steps of the CERCLA process. The available information presented in the HRS documentation record \\nat proposal establishes an HRS site score exceeding the 28.50 threshold and qualifying the Site for NPL listing \\nbased on the current conditions at the Site. Site -related contamination remains in sediment s and soil as \\ndocumented in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The EPA has determined that this site- related \\ncontamination appears to warrant further investigation and potential remediation. Other ongoing investigations do \\nnot negate the need for listing. Nevertheless, the results of the Upper Columbia River RI/FS will be taken into account as part of later stages of the CERCLA process for the Site.   \\n As previously indicated in section 3.11, Due Process, of this support document , and  consistent with CERCLA, the \\nEPA has in place a procedure for identifying sites where releases of substances addressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the NPL, evaluating the nature and extent of the threats at such sites, responding to those threats, and deleting sites f rom the NPL. The purpose of the initial two steps is to develop the \\nNPL which identifies for the States and the public those sites that appear to warrant further investigation and \\npotential remedial action. The evaluation or RI/FS phase involves on- site te sting to define the nature and extent of \\nthe threat posed by the contamination and to identify alternatives for remedial action. The RI/FS investigation Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 31  typically occurs following listing on the NPL. (However, as noted in section 3.10, Purpose of Listing, of this \\nsupport document, for this Site, the RI/FS has been ongoing and is proceeding in parallel with NPL listing.)  \\n \\nThus, the purpose of NPL listing is to identify sites warranting further investigation to fully assess the extent of \\nrisk posed by the site (and ultimately to evaluate and determine what CERCLA- financed remedial actions, if any, \\nmay be appropriate). The RI/FS identifies the extent of contamination and possible remedies to address that contamination. In this case, both steps are being done concurrently, as there is a party conducting an RI/FS \\npursuant to a settlement agreement, and, at the same time, there i s sufficient information available to justify NPL \\nlisting.  \\n Regarding the data and documentation used to evaluate and score the Site with the HRS, sufficient data and \\ndocumentation were used for the purposes of HRS scoring as explained in detail in section 3.3, Adequacy of \\nDocumentation, of this support document.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.13 Consistency with Guidance/Use of Guidance \\nComment: TAI and Stevens County submitted comments questioning aspects of EPA guidance documents and \\nthe application of guidance:  \\n \\n• TAI asserted that the HRS Guidance Manual  indicates that, when addressing an area with multiple \\nsources, the EPA can use its discretion to determine whether one or more sites is present for HRS scoring purposes. TAI commented that it disagreed with the EPA’s consideration of the Le Roi  smelter as a part \\nof the Site due to comingling of releases.  \\n• In discussing EPA guidance developed using an extrapolation of Center for Disease Control (CDC) \\nguidance for blood lead levels, Stevens County commented that prior blood lead studies:  \\nshow NO elevated lead levels in children, the most vulnerable population, from the old standards prior to the new guidance. As guidance is simply that and has not been \\navailable for public comment, and extrapolation of data is a scientific guess with no degree [of] certainty, it draws the conclusion that lead levels of blood in the children and \\npopulation in the area should be done prior to scoring being completed to show there is \\nan issue. Scoring should be done on known risks, not guesses by those in the agency.…  \\n• TAI commented on the EPA’s new lead screening level guidance. It pointed to a March 5, 2024, EPA \\nnews release\\n16 in which the EPA noted that soil at more than 194 residential areas related to the Site \\ninvolve lead at levels that exceed the new EPA screening level for residential lead contamination . TAI \\ncommented that guidance for the new screening level does not prescribe cleanup levels (and that site-\\nspecific screening levels are already set).  \\n \\n• TAI asserted that the HRS Guidance Manual indicates that releases are scored based on the threat at the \\ntime of scoring.  \\n \\nResponse : The EPA followed the HRS regulation to list the Site on the NPL. Furthermore, unlike the HRS \\nregulation itself, the HRS Guidance Manual  and other EPA guidance are not regulations and impose no \\nmandatory requirements on the Agency.  \\n \\n \\n16 The news release is available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -wa-\\nsuperfund- list.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 32  Regardless, the Interim Final  HRS Guidance Manual was also applied appropriately in the HRS evaluation based \\non the facts and circumstances known to be present for this Site at proposal; any variation in applying the HRS \\nGuidance Manual  was carried out to reflect site-specific conditions. The  HRS Guidance Manual states that:  \\n \\n[t]he procedures set forth in this document are intended as guidance to employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), States, and other government agencies. EPA officials \\nmay decide to follow the guidance provided in this directive, or to ac t at variance with it, based \\non analysis of specific site circumstances.  \\n In evaluating whether a site merits NPL listing, the EPA complies with the HRS and uses the HRS Guidance \\nManual as just that—guidance to determine how best to perform the HRS evaluation based on the facts or \\ncircumstances presented at each site. The HRS Guidance Manual is consistent with the HRS (this was not \\nchallenged by the commenters), and the EPA has followed the HRS in scoring the Site and applied the  HRS \\nGuidance Manual , as appropriate, depending on the facts presented by this Site.  \\n \\nRegarding the consideration of the Le Roi smelter as a part of the Site due to comingling of releases, the Site was \\nappropriately evaluated as the comingled contamination from historical releases associated with the Cominco and \\nLe Roi smelters  as discussed in detail in section 3.6, Commingled Contamination, of this support document.  \\n Regarding consistency with the draft EPA’s Updated Residential Soil Lead Guidance for CERCLA Sites and \\nRCRA Corrective Action Facilities\\n17 guidance document, this document is intended to only provide \\nrecommendations and present guidance on evaluating sites at stages unrelated to the listing stage of the CERCLA  \\nprocess. This guidance document provides residential soil lead regional screening levels (RSLs) and regional removal management levels (RMLs), which are used during other stages of the CERCLA  process for remedial \\nand removal actions. Further, these screening levels are not used in the HRS evaluation and therefore have no impact on the HRS score.   \\nRegarding the absence of elevated blood lead levels, the HRS does not require blood lead sampling in scoring \\nsites for NPL listing  nor require inclu sion of blood lead levels directly in  any of the HRS factors. Additionally, the \\nEPA also  does  not require , or encourage, blood lead sampling for CERCLA risk assessments as indicated in EPA \\nguidance.\\n18 The EPA ’s mission is to protect human health and the environment by prevent ing adverse health \\neffects from pollution . The EPA does not require evidence of elevated blood lead levels before HRS scoring  of a \\nsite or taking actions to protect human health. Please see section, 3.15, Risk to Human Health and the \\nEnvironment, of this support document for additional discussion of blood lead level studies.  \\n \\nRegarding the comments suggesting that a determination of a specific level of risk associated with the Site be made, as noted above, the Site was evaluated using the HRS regulation which is a screening tool intended to \\nprovide a limited evaluation of a sit e. The determination of site- specific risk occurs at a separate stage of the \\nCERCLA process, and comments discussing the possible risk posed by the Site are addressed in section 3.15, Risk to Human Health or the Environment, of this support document.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.14 Ongoing Investigation and Remediation  \\nComment: TAI, the Government of Canada, and two citizens commented that extensive remediation and \\ninvestigation of the Site have occurred and are ongoing. TAI commented that an RI/FS is ongoing, the BERA is \\n \\n17 Information regarding this EPA guidance document and the purpose of screening levels can be found at \\nhttps://www.epa.gov/superfund/updated -soil-lead-guidance -cercla- sites-and-rcra-corrective- action -facilities .  \\n18 The EPA memorandum , Recommendations for Using Blood Lead Data at Superfund and RCRA  \\nCorrective Action Sites , is available online at https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/11/100000158 . Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n33 ongoing, and the human health risk assessment (HHRA) has been completed. TAI stated that the HRS “ approach  \\nlargely does not account for the extensive RI/FS work already done.” As part of the comments provided by TAI \\non the robust nature of the remedial work Teck has been completing, it commented that:  \\n•Th\\ne HHRA indicated that unacceptable levels of contamination are not present in surface water and fish\\nfrom the Upper Columbia River.\\n•Many of the residential properties with lead -contaminated soil above the EPA action levels have been\\nremediated.\\n•The work completed as part of the ongoing RI/FS included a Tribal consumption and use survey and arecreational use survey.\\n•The draft BERA for the aquatic portion of the Site has been submitted and is a comprehensive aquaticecologic risk assessment\\n•Analysis of thousands of samples from the Site has occurred.\\n•Multiple types of environmental media have been sampled and assessed.\\nTA\\nI and the Government of Canada submitted comments pointing to the ongoing RI/FS. The Government of \\nCanada stated that “[i]t is expected that the results included in these reports will provide essential data on the \\nextent and magnitude of risks as well as identify data gaps for future studies,” and it noted that a hydro-dynamic \\nmodel may provide additional data regarding the transport of slag in the river. The Government of Canada \\nrequested that the nature and extent of the completed and on- going remedial work be clearly stated. TAI also \\nstated that “the nature and necessity of any final remedial action will be determined on a site- specific basis in the \\nRI/FS.” It commented that the aquatic RI report is ongoing and the FS and Records of Decision will occur following the RI.\\n19  \\nAs p\\nart of its comments regarding the extensive remedial work completed for the Site and the evaluation of the \\nSite, TAI asserted that the HRS is an inappropriate tool for evaluating a site with extensive completed remedial \\nwork and available data. TAI stated that while evaluating NPL placement in the early stages of site assessment is \\nappropriate,20 the function of listing to serve as a quick and inexpensive tool21 for assessing sites does not apply to \\na site like the Upper Columbia River, which already has extensive data and an ongoing RI/FS. It commented that unlike this Site where investigation has been occurring for 20 years, NPL placement usually occurs early i n the \\nsite evaluation process. It asserted that NPL placement typically also does not occur where a funded on -going \\nRI/FS is occurring. \\nTA\\nI commented that while the EPA’s stated primary concern is reducing residential exposure to lead in soil, the \\nEPA also noted that NPL listing would not change the process, investigation, or remediation, culminating in the \\nremediation of both upland soil and aquatic areas associated with the Site.22 In discussing the remediation process, \\nTAI commented that an RI/FS is already mandated as part of a Settlement Agreement between EPA and Teck.  \\nResponse : The  EPA has determined that listing the Site on the NPL is the next appropriate step in the CERCLA \\nprocess. Future remedial actions are not considered during the HRS evaluation of the Site because an HRS site score is based on current conditions . Here, the Site warrants placement on the NPL as evidenced by the Site \\nachieving an HRS site score above the listing threshold based on an assessment of the current conditions.  \\n19 TAI pointed to Attachment A of its comment submissi on, which includes a timeline of related RI/FS work.  \\n20 TAI quoted Carus Chem. Co. v. EPA , 395 F.3d 434, 437 (D.C. Cir. 2005) to support the nature of  an NPL designation only \\nensuring additional study.  \\n21 TAI quoted Wash. State Dep’t of Transp. v. EPA , 917 F.2d 1309, 1310 (D.C. Cir.1990) to support that the listing stage of \\nthe CERCLA process is a tool for identifying sites warranting further study.  \\n22 TAI pointed to Attachments B And C of its comment submission, which include copies of the EPA and TAI’s \\npresentations to the EWCOG.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 34   \\nWith regard  to completed remedial work, completed removal  actions have been  considered in the assessment of \\nthe Site.  Although response actions may have been completed and other investigations are ongoing, the Site is still \\neligible for NPL placement, and the conditions at the Site qualify for listing as established by the Site achieving an HRS site score of 51.15. The RI/FS referenced by the commenters is ongoing per a settlement agreement. This \\nsettlement  agreement covers the RI/FS but does not provide  for a potential  site-wide cleanup. However, \\ncompleted response actions and the results of ongoing investigations, including the results of the RI/FS, will be considered in subsequent stages of the CERCLA  process.  \\n \\nAdditionally, numerous completed and ongoing investigations were acknowledged in the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal. Pages 14-16 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed investigations into the \\nUpper Columbia River and associated soil contamination in the Northport area. Page 16 of the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal discussed \\nthat “ numerous EPA Removal activities have occurred in the \\nNorthport, Washington area, including several removal site evaluations (RSEs).”   \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.15 Risk to Human Health and  the Environment \\nComment: TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens submitted comments questioning whether the Site poses a \\nrisk. Stevens County and eight citizens commented that the available studies do not appear to indicate a risk posed \\nby the Site. Stevens County commented that except for bacteria, which have not been tested for, the Columbia \\nRiver meets water quality standards. One citizen commented that tests to determine whether there is a risk posed \\nby metal contamination have not been completed.  \\n \\nIn discussing the risks associated with the Columbia River, nine citizens commented that the water is clean and/or \\nmeets water quality standards. Three  citizens stated that there are no human health risks associated with the Upper \\nColumbia River , the Site  and/or Lake Roosevelt. Eight citizens commented that fish are safe to consume. One \\ncommenter asserted the area is clean except for rubbish.  \\n TAI asserted that there has been a miscommunication whether a human health risk is present associated with the \\nUpper Columbia River. TAI asserted that the Columbia River does not pose a risk based on past reports. TAI \\ncommented that an HHRA has been completed, showing no human health risks. TAI also noted a draft BERA has \\nbeen submitted for the aquatic portion of the Site and is a comprehensive assessment of aquatic ecological risk.  \\nTAI stated that the HRS documentation record at proposal focuses on metal c ontamination in sediments which \\nhas been determined to not pose a risk to human health. Regarding the risk posed by the Upper Columbia River, TAI commented that the river is safe, asserting that:  \\n \\n• The water in the Columbia River is safe.  \\n• The beaches are safe, except for one closed beach.  \\n• The fish from the Columbia River are safe to consume except for largescale suckers.  \\n• The river has a healthy game fishery. \\n• The aquatic portion of the Site does not pose actionable human health risks. \\n• Risk calculations completed in the HHRA determined that contaminants of concern were not associated \\nwith surface water exposure pathways. \\n Commenting on the risk associated with contaminated soil, TAI asserted that, while public communications have \\nconveyed that the Upper Columbia River is safe, the EPA has emphasized a possible human health risk associated \\nwith contaminated soil in the Northport area. TAI commented that a March 5, 2024, EPA news release refers to Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 35  soil contamination as the main risk posed by the Site and pointed to the news releases’ discussion23 of residential \\nareas above the EPA’s new screening level. TAI stated that a human health risk associated with lead in residential \\nsoil has been emphasized and stated that “the potential justification for Listing —if there even is one—is primarily \\ndue to re sidential properties in and around Northport” as opposed to contamination in the Columbia River. \\nRegarding soil contamination, TAI commented that:   \\n• The majority of properties with soil contamination above the action level have been cleaned up.  \\n• The RI and ecological risk assessment for the upland soil contamination is ongoing and close to completion.  \\n• A significant amount of work has been completed.  \\n• The residential soil contamination has been overstated by including non- residential areas in the scope.  \\n• Soil contamination affecting numerous residential properties as a result of the former Le Roi/Northport smelter operations is being addressed via removal and remedial actions.  \\n• Impacted upland soil contamination has been addressed to the current a ction level.  \\n• The potential human health risk is associated with lead in soil in a small portion of the uplands area adjacent to the former Le Roi smelter.  \\n• The impacts of air emissions and dusts from the Le Roi smelter have not been fully assessed and \\ndelineated. \\n In commenting on the risk posed by the Site based on testing of blood levels, Stevens County and EWCOG \\ncommented that local blood testing does not indicate a health concern. Stevens County commented that local \\nstudies do not indicate elevated blood levels in children, which were considered the most vulnerable group under the prior EPA guidance. Stevens County asserted that: \\n \\n• “[I]t draws the conclusion that lead levels of blood in the children and population in the area should be done prior to scoring being completed to show there is an issue.” \\n• “Scoring should be done on known risks.”  \\n \\nAdditionally, two citizens asserted that data from blood lead level testing on children do not support NPL designation.  \\n \\nIn discussing the HRS scoring, TAI commented that the technical reasoning for the proposed listing is \\ninconsistent with past EPA communication regarding the risk posed by the Site. [31] Stevens County stated that \\n“[i]t is hard to know why the scores are so high to warrant listing with no human health risk and data backing up this conclusion.”  \\n \\nResponse : The EPA considers that there is a potential threat to human health and the environment posed by the \\ncontamination in the surface water sediments and soil and that this threat warrants further investigation  and \\npotential further response actions . Consistent with CERCLA, this Site is being placed on the NPL based on an \\nHRS evaluation of the risk relative to other sites being considered for the NPL resulting from the release of \\nhazardous substances to the Upper Columbia River and exposure to contaminated  soil in residential yards.  \\n \\n \\n23 The news release is available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -wa-\\nsuperfund- list. TAI pointed to the following statement in the EPA’s news release, “[t]he agency has determined that soils \\ncontaminated with lead and arsenic pose unacceptable risk to residents at affected properties, particularly to children. EPA \\ndetermined that soil in  at least 194 residential areas contain lead at levels that exceed the agency’s new screening level for \\nresidential lead contamination.”  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 36  The EPA has not assumed site- specific risks are present at this Site in determining that the Site qualifies for \\nplacement on the NPL. The Site achieved an HRS site score above 28.50, which demonstrates that the Site poses \\na sufficient relative risk to warr ant further investigation. The HRS is not a site -specific risk assessment; rather, it \\nis a screening tool used to help the EPA determine priorities for cleanup, and possible response activities, and \\nrepresents relative risk among sites undergoing HRS evaluation. Actual determinations of site -specific risk that is \\nposed to human health or the environment are determined during a different stage of the CERCLA process.  \\n \\nThe NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation, \\npotential further response action, and to  assess the nature and extent of public health and environmental risks \\nassociated with a release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. See 89 FR 16498 (Proposed Rule, \\nUpper Columbia River, March 7, 2024); see also 55 FR 51532 (Final Rule, H azard Ranking System, December \\n14, 1990) and 82 FR 2760 (Addition of Subsurface Intrusion Component to the Hazard Ranking System, January \\n9, 2017). CERCLA § 105(a)(8)(a) requires the EPA to determine NPL priorities among sites based on the \\n“relative risk o r danger to public health or welfare, or the environment.” The criteria the EPA applies to determine \\nthis relative risk or danger is codified in the HRS, and is the Agency’s primary tool for deriving a site score based on the factors identified in CERCLA. The HRS evaluation and score above 28.50 represents the EPA’s \\ndetermination that the Site may pose a relative risk or threat to human health and the environment and warrants \\nfurther investigation under CERCLA. As part of the standard CERCLA  process, once t he Site is on the NPL, the \\ninvestigations performed to date to characterize the Site will be evaluated for completeness, further information will be collected if deemed necessary to adequately characterize the risks posed by the Site, and based on this \\ninformation, a risk assessment decision will be made determining what, if any, remedial action is necessary to \\nprotect human health and the environment.  \\n \\nRegarding comments asserting that there is either no risk or limited risk posed by exposure to soil at the Site, as \\nnoted above the specific risk posed by soil contamination at the site is not determined by an HRS evaluation. \\nWhile risk is typically determined during a later stage of the CERCLA  process , as part of the ongoing RI/FS, \\nsome risk assessment s for portions of the Site  have been completed or started. The full extent of the risk posed by \\nthe Site has not been determined , and the potential risk pose d by the Site  will continue to be evaluated as part of \\nsubsequent stages of the CERCLA process.  Regardless, the HRS evaluation of the Site documented lead and \\narsenic contamination in soil that met observed contamination criteria sufficient for HRS scoring purposes. Additionally, multiple hazardous substances have been documented in surface water se diments to meet HRS \\nrequirements for observed release (antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc), and \\nslag containing hazardous subs tances is documented to have been released directly into the Columbia River. \\nThese hazardous substances present in surface water sediments and in soil are in part attributable to the Site as \\nlisted at proposal.  \\n \\nIn 2021, the  EPA completed the  HHRA at the Site and concluded that risks associated with human exposure to \\ncontaminated soils exceeds risk -based benchmarks on residential and common use properties. The  EPA’s HHRA \\nconcluded that human ingestion of certain fish species, including large -scale suckers, exceed ed risk-based \\nbenchmarks. (See pages 39 and 40 of the HHRA included as Reference 17 of the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal.)  \\n Regarding comments discussing the risk the Site may pose based on the testing of blood lead levels from local \\npopulations, blood lead levels are not required for HRS scoring and not used in an HRS evaluation of a site. \\nSufficient relative risk was established by the Site achieving an NPL eligible HRS site score of 51.15 based on the \\nHRS scoring of the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and \\nsubsurface intrusion pathway.  \\n \\nSee also section 3.14, Ongoing Investigation and Remediation,  of this support document for information related to \\ninvestigation and remedial efforts at the Site, and section 3.2, Community Involvement, of this support document \\nfor discussion of comments about public communications.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 37  This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.16 Regulatory Limits and Screening Levels \\nComment : Several commenters provided comments discussing contamination compared to screening levels and \\nregulatory limits.  \\n \\nWater Quality Several commenters stated there were little to no surface water concentrations that exceeded water quality \\nstandards in the Upper Columbia River. TAI commented that the Upper Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt \\nsurface water data indicated few metals have been detected at concentrations exceeding generic water quality benchmarks and standards. Stevens County stated  that the water in Upper Columbia River  and Lake Roosevelt \\nmeets and exceeds drinking water standards, which makes it hard to understand “ why the s cores are so high to \\nwarrant listing with no human health risk and data backing up this conclusion.” SCBID commented that comprehensive surface water sampling in the Upper Columbia River, including where irrigation water is drawn \\nfrom the river , has yielded results that were all below human health and ecological surface water screening levels. \\nSeveral  citizens commented that the water in Lake Roosevelt meets drinking water standards and with some \\ncharacterizing the situation as “hardly an environmental cata strophe ”; the same commenters  recognized there is \\nmetals contamination in sediment s, but described it as trapped or buried in river sediments. One additional public \\ncommenter stated that tests show most of the lake water meets drinking water standards and most fish are edible with no adverse health issues being reported by those who eat the fish.  \\n One citizen  commented that  while the EPA indicated that there are locations with slag that can lower water \\nquality levels, most people do not use river water for drinking water.  Soil \\nTAI commented  that many residential properties that exceed ed the EPA assigned site- specific action l evel of 700 \\nparts per million (ppm) lead in soil ha ve already been cleaned up. It commented that it is unclear if scoring the \\nupland areas alone would be sufficient to support adding this site to the NPL because these residential properties that exceed the site-specific action level have been cleaned up and the area is sparsely populated. Stevens County commented that all residential properties exceeding prev ious guidance on lead levels have been cleaned up, noting \\nthat lead levels alone do not indicate a need for remedial actions.  \\n \\nMultiple commenters questioned the use and validity of new EPA lead level guidance. TAI asserted  that the \\nexistence of areas with lead concentrations above the EPA’s new screening levels  is not an appropriate basis for \\nadding a site to the NPL. TAI also commented that an action l evel has already been set, a ction has been taken, and \\nthe RI/FS is currently underway to determine the type and necessity of remedial actions. TAI contended that the \\nEPA’s new screening level does not justify listing, as there is no indication that the current action level for the Site is not protective. Stevens County argued that the EPA’s new soil lead screening level guidance is associated \\nwith questions regarding its validity and there is no science-based connection to blood levels in vulnerable \\npopulations. Stevens County also commented that blood studies conducted by the local health district show no \\nelevated lead levels in children, prior to the new EPA lead guidance. Stevens County noted that the new EPA lead \\nguidance, which is not complete yet, will not match the metal levels regulated by the state of Washington. A citizen also claimed that “ EPA changed the levels downward to match the data” because lead levels in the Stevens \\nCounty area were not high enough to support the listing decision.   \\nResponse: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly documented an observed release of metals, \\nincluding antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead zinc, and mercury, to the Upper Columba River based on sediment samples and established the presence of lead and arsenic in soil at concentrations meeting \\nobserved contamination criteria. That releases to the Upper Columbia River and contamination in the soil may be \\nbelow various site, State, or EPA cleanup standards and goals does not eliminate those hazardous substances or Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 38  their releases from consideration when evaluating a site using the HRS.  CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(B) directs the \\nEPA to list on the NPL “releases” of hazardous substances, pollutants and contaminants according to specific \\ncriteria set out in CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(A). The definition of “release” in CERCLA Section 101(22) \\nexem pts certain releases from its scope, but it does not exempt releases below regulatory limits (or \\nscreening/action levels).  \\n \\nThe concentrations of hazardous substances evaluated in the HRS documentation record at proposal were eligible \\nfor consideration consistent with the HRS. On July 16, 1982, when responding to public comments on the \\nproposed (original) HRS (47 FR 31188), and again on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40665), the EPA rejected the \\nidea that releases within regulatory limits should not be considered “observed releases” under the HRS. As the \\nEPA noted in 1982:  \\n \\n[E]mission or effluent limits do not necessarily represent levels which cause no harm to public \\nhealth or the environment. These limitations are frequently established on the basis of economic \\nimpacts or achievability.  \\n \\nBy contrast, an observed release represents a 100 percent likelihood that substances can migrate from the site (47 FR 31188, July 16, 1982). Similarly, observed contamination (the soil exposure counterpart for the HRS observed \\nrelease used in other HRS pat hways) documents that a hazardous substance is present in the surface at \\nconcentrations significantly above background.  \\n Section 2.3 of the revised HRS (55 FR 51589, December 14, 1990) states that an observed release can be \\nestablished either by direct observation or by chemical analysis. An observed release by chemical analysis has \\noccurred when a contaminant is measured si gnificantly above background level if some portion of the release is \\nattributable to the site; observed contamination is documented when a hazardous substance attributable to the site \\nis present at a concentration significantly above background levels for the site within two feet of the surface. \\nAlthough contaminant levels may be lower than regulatory limits, an observed release or observed contamination \\nis nevertheless considered to have occurred if the measured levels are significantly higher than backgro und levels. \\nThe HRS does, however, consider whether releases are above regulatory limits in evaluating target populations, increasing by a factor of 10 the weight assigned populations exposed to contaminants above regulatory limits.  For \\nthis Site, observed releases by both direct observation and chemical analysis were established for the surface \\nwater migration pathway at the Site (see pages 55 -76 of the HRS documentation record at proposal). The \\nobserved release by chemical analysis at this Site was established based on sediment samples collected from the \\nriver. An area of observed contamination was established, as well as Level I targets , for the soil exposure \\ncomponent  of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway (see pages 92 -95 and 108 of the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal).  \\n \\nDocumentation of an observed release or observed exposure and associated HRS likelihood of release/likelihood \\nof exposure factors alone  are not intended to reflect the hazard presented by the particular release. Instead, the \\nhazard of a site is approximated by the total HRS score, which incorporates the likelihood of release/likelihood of exposure factors  with other factors such as waste characteristics (including waste quantity, toxicity, ecotoxicity, \\npersistence, and bioaccumulation) and targets. This tot al HRS score reflects the hazard of the site relative to the \\nother sites that have been scored. A more comprehensive characterization of the contamination, associated releases, and the impacts thereof are fully determined during the RI that typically follo ws listing.   \\n Regarding the commenters’ claim that many residential properties that exceed the EPA assigned site- specific \\naction level have already been cleaned up, the Site has been appropriately evaluated with respect to the response \\nactions  and current conditions. The EPA consider s current conditions, including changes in site conditions due to \\nall removal and remedial activities, when it considers what CERCLA action, if any, is warranted at a site on the \\nNPL. For example, page 92 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 39  [h]owever, since EPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area \\ndating back to 2003 [see Site Summary  section of this HRS documentation record], not all \\nproperties were included within the AOC polygon; for the purpose of determining the hazardous waste quantity area and resident population for the AOC, a conservative approach was taken and only contaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did not have soil \\nremovals, were included in the calculation . [emphasis  added]  \\n \\nRelated to the comments on the use and validity of the EPA’s new lead level guidance, this lead level guidance is \\nnot relevant to HRS scoring or NPL listing; see section 3.13, Consistency with Guidance/Use of Guidance, of this support document for more det ails. Additionally, blood lead levels are not required for HRS scoring and are not \\nused in an HRS evaluation of a site.   \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.17 Other Non-Listing Activities  \\nComment : Several commenters submitted comments discussing activities that are not directly related to placing \\nthe Site on the NPL. \\n \\nThe EWCOG, SCBID, and EBID expressed concern that the proposed NPL placement of the Site could possibly \\nimpact the on -going Columbia River Treaty negotiations between the U.S. Government and the Government of \\nCanada.   \\nStevens County commented that it disagreed with Governor Jay Inslee’s letter of concurrence for the NPL listing of the Site. It asserted that local officials were not consulted or contacted prior to the Governor submitting a letter \\nof concurrence. Stevens County requested that the Governor retract the letter of concurrence. Stevens County also \\nrequested that the Governor discuss the NPL listing with local officials before supporting NPL designation of the \\nSite.  \\n \\nTwo citizens submitted comments discussing  the dam (Grand Coulee Dam) . One commenter opposed listing \\npointing to the need for the nearby dams for hydroelectric power and for agricultural irrigation purposes and noting that the dams have fish passages. A second citizen submitted similar comments, noting the value of the \\ndam for hydroelectric power and irrigation; the commenter stated that if fish are the concern, mitigation of fish \\nmigration pathways should occur via a fish ladder or other alternatives as opposed to removal of the dam.   \\nResponse: Comments presenting  concerns regarding the on -going Columbia River Treaty negotiations, the \\ncoordination efforts between the Governor and local officials , and impacts to the Grand Coulee Dam  have been \\nnoted and are in the public record for the Site. These topics fall outside of the scope of the present listing action; therefore, these comments do not impact the HRS site score or the decision to list the Site on the NPL.  \\n \\nRegarding the Columbia River Treaty negotiations discussed by commenters, these negotiations are handled by \\nthe State Department and are outside the scope of the listing decision. The State Department is involved with \\nthese negotiations and provides additional information for interested individuals on its Columbia River Treaty \\nwebpage ( https://www.state.gov/columbia- river -treaty/ ). \\n Regarding Stevens County’s concerns about the Governor’s concurrence letter  and coordination with local \\nofficials , the Governor of the s tate of Washington supported NPL designation in his letter expressing concurrence \\nwith the EPA’s decision to list the Site on the NPL. The letter of concurrence, in part, states “ [o]n behalf of the \\nstate of Washington, I strongly support the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed listing of the \\nUpper Columbia River (UCR) Site on the National Priorities List (NPL).” Additionally, Stevens County’s Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 40  concerns regarding coordination efforts between the Governor and local officials are outside the scope of the \\npresent NPL listing action.  \\n Additionally, the NPL designation of the Site does not determine the fate of the dam  (the Grand Co ulee Dam ). \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.18 Non-Scoring HRS Documentation Record Comments \\nComment : TAI and the Government of Canada provided comments discussing possible inconsistencies in the \\nHRS documentation record at proposal relating to discussion of slag releases and/or the discussion of a fish advisory study.  \\n \\nRegarding slag releases, the Government of Canada requested that revisions be made in the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal to clarify that these are historical releases that occurred only up through 1996, with the \\nexception of three  accidental releases in 1998. The Government of Canada stated that slag has not been \\ndischarged from the Cominco  smelter since 1998 and requested that the discussion clarify that current effluent \\ndoes not contain slag. The Government of Canada also requested additional revisions related to slag releases, \\nsuggesting changes to the following discussions in  the HRS documentation record at proposal: \\n \\n• The discussion on page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal referring to Cominco’s \\noperations as characterized by frequent accidental releases into the river should be clarified as historical.  \\n• The discussion on page 55 of the HRS documentation record at proposal noting that, “[t]he BC MOE \\nrequired the elimination of slag to the Columbia River by December 1996; however; since this time, \\nCominco has had several releases of slag to the river” should be clarified as historical.  \\n• The discussion on pages 53 and 55 of the HRS documentation record at proposal described probable point \\nof entry ( PPE) 1, associated with the Trail facility, in present tense and PPE2, associated with the Le Roi \\nsmelter, in past tense, even though the Trail facility halted slag releases to the river in 1996 and thus this \\nshould be corrected. \\n• The discussion on page 77 of the HRS documentation record at proposal that refers to “outfalls that \\ndischarge effluent and slag” to the river should be clarified as historical.  \\n• The description of the table on page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal should be revised to \\n“‘Table 1 lists hazardous substances present in Cominco outfall effluent in 199[5/6].’” \\n \\nRegarding the discussion of a Washington State Department of Health (WSDH)  fish advisory (Reference 52 of \\nthe HRS documentation record at proposal), TAI and the Government of Canada commented that the discussion of the fish advisory on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal appear ed to incorrectly discuss the \\nadvisory. TAI asserted that the HRS documentation record at proposal misidentified the origin of a statement identifying Teck as the source of metals in the river in stating “ ‘[a] [Washing ton State Department of Health \\n(WSDH)]  fish consumption advisory Technical Summary (dated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a \\nprimary source of metals and other chemical contaminants in the UCR’ ”; instead of the Washington State \\nDepartment of Health, TAI commented that the origin is actually identified in the advisory document as the EPA. \\nThe Government of Canada questioned the same statement, noting that it appear ed to suggest that Teck is a source \\nof fish advisories associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)  and mercury even though smelters and \\natmospheric sources are identified in the report. The Government of Canada noted that the report refers to Teck because the WS DH used data related to Teck from a fish study. The Government of Canada requested that the \\nstatement on page 84 be revised to clarify the reason for the advisory.   Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 41  Response:  The commenters’ points about possible inconsistencies in the HRS documentation record at proposal \\nhave been noted and are included as a part of the record for the Site because they were submitted to the docket as \\ncomments. While the EPA acknowledges the po ints provided by the commenters, the EPA notes that these \\npossible inconsistencies do not affect the HRS site score or impact the decision to add the Site to the NPL.  \\n \\nThe commenter is correct that the supporting information indicates that slag discharges from Teck were historical, \\nand the EPA does  not dispute these as historical  discharges; this is evidenced by the below items from the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal . Page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal state d, “[s] lag, \\nhistorically  discharged via smelter outfalls to the Columbia River….” [emphasis added] Further, page 31 stated \\n“[t]he B.C. Ministry of Environment, Lands, and Parks required the elimination of slag to the Columbia River by \\nDecember 1996; however, since this time, Cominco has had several releases of slag to the river during upset \\nconditions.” Page 55 stated “Cominco operated four outfalls that have historically  discharged slag and effluent \\ndirectly to the Columbia River .” [emphasis added] The statement regarding frequent accidental releases on HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal page 31 was intended to describe a wider array of spills (only some of which \\ninclude slag), as further detailed on HRS documentation record at proposal pages 55-57. Page 55 provided a \\ntimeline for the releases and specifically stated that not all of the releases involved hazardous substances:  \\n \\nCominco’s operations have been characterized by frequent accidental releases of contaminants into the UCR. On 86 occasions between September 1987 and May 2001, Cominco reported \\nspills of pollutants into the UCR; although not all would necessarily involve hazardous \\nsubstances …. [emphasis added] \\n \\nTable 8 of the HRS documentation record list ed historical spills, only some of which mention slag.  \\n All of  this information indicates that the HRS documentation record at proposal recognized the releases of slag \\nfrom Cominco were , for the most part , historical.  \\n The discussion of PPE1 on page 53 of the HRS documentation record at proposal began  by stating “ Cominco \\noperates outfalls that have historically discharged slag and effluent directly to the UCR” [emphasis added] and \\nsubsequent discussion of PPE1 in the present tense generally involves HRS scoring elements (the HRS probable \\npoint of entry itself, the HRS in- water segment, the HRS target distance limit). PPEs can be historical in nature, \\nand t here are no HRS requirements that PPEs or releases have to be occur ring in the present day to be eligible for \\nHRS listing.  \\n \\nRegarding the paragraph concerning the fish advisory on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal , \\nthe commenter is correct that Teck is not the sole cause of the fish advisory , and the intent of the HRS \\ndocumentation record was not to imply that Teck was the sole cause. T he intent of the associated statements in the \\nHRS documentation record at proposal was simply to note that 1) fish advisories are in place that affect the Upper \\nColumbia River, 2) the advisories are due to both PCBs ( which is not  associated with the Site) and mercury \\n(which is  associated with the Site); and Teck is a significant contributor to contaminants (including contaminants \\nin the river).  \\n On the origin of identification of the Cominco  smelter as a primary source of metals and other chemical \\ncontaminants in the Upper Columbia River, the EPA acknowledges that the commenters are correct and clarifies \\nthat, although the supporting statement is housed in a WSDH document, that document attributes the \\nidentification to the EPA.  \\n \\nBecause these issues do not affect the HRS site score or the decision to list the Site on the NPL, the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal itself will not be revised; however , these clarifications are part of the record for \\nthe Site by virtue of inclusion in this support document.  \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 42   \\n3.19 Hazardous Substance Definition \\nComment : TAI commented that slag is not a CERCLA hazardous substance and is not included in 40 CFR part \\n302, Table 302.4, List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities. TAI also asserted that the solid waste \\ndefinition in 40 CFR 261.4 excludes slag. TAI stated that the hazardous constituent quantity is based only on the \\nmass of CERCLA hazardous substances. TAI asserted that since slag is not a hazardous substance under \\nCERLCA, using slag to determine the hazardous waste quantity for Source 1 is incorrect and misleading.  \\n \\nResponse: Slag is appropriate to use in determining the hazardous waste quantity for a source in the HRS \\nevaluation of a site because it is a source material that contains hazardous substances. Although “slag” is indeed \\nnot itself a CERCLA hazardous substance, it contains CERCLA hazardous substances eligible for HRS scoring, \\nand the hazardous substances within the slag evaluated as part of Source 124 were appropriately associated with \\nthe source. A material need not be a “solid waste” or “hazardous waste” under the 40 CFR Part 261 list for \\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA) to be addressed under CERCLA. \\n HRS Section 1.1, Definitions , defines a hazardous substance for HRS purposes as “CERCLA hazardous \\nsubstances, pollutants, and contaminants as defined in CERCLA Sections 101(14) and 101(33), except where otherwise specifically noted in the HRS.” Additionally:  \\n• CERCLA Section 101(14) defines “hazardous substance” in the context of other f ederal legislation, \\nincluding substances listed pursuant to Sections 307(a) and 311(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (known as RCRA), and Section 112 of the \\nClean Air Act, and substances that are the subject of an action under Section 7 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. It states that a CERCLA “hazardous substance” is:  \\n(A) any substance designated pursuant to section 311(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A)], (B) any element, compound, mixture, \\nsolution, or substance designated pursuant to section 9602 of this title, (C) any hazardous \\nwaste having the characteristics identified under or listed pursuant to section 3001 of the \\nSolid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6921] (but not including any waste the regulation of which under the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.] has been suspended \\nby Act of Congress), (D) any toxic pollutant listed under section 307(a) of the Federal \\nWater Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1317(a)], (E) any hazardous air pollutant listed \\nunder section 112 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7412], and (F) a ny imminently \\nhazardous chemical substance or mixture with respect to which the Administrator has \\ntaken action pursuant to section 7 of the Toxic Substances Control Act [15 U.S.C. 2606]. \\nThe term does not include petroleum, including crude oil or any fract ion thereof which is \\nnot otherwise specifically listed or designated as a hazardous substance under subparagraphs (A) through (F) of this paragraph, and the term does not include natural \\ngas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usa ble for fuel (or mixtures \\nof natural gas and such synthetic gas).”  \\nThus, hazardous wastes as defined under RCRA are only a subset of the broader list of CERCLA \\nhazardous substances.  \\n \\n24 Page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal referred  to the name of Source 1 as “Cominco Outfalls Slag”; \\nhowever, for HRS scoring purposes, Source 1 does not solely consist of slag and is defined as “effluent from outfalls from a \\nlead, silver, and zinc smelter and fertilizer production operation owned by Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada, Ltd.  (Cominco). ” Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 43  • CERCLA Section 102(a) empowers the Administrator to promulgate regulations designating other \\nsubstances as hazardous if when released into the environment they may present substantial danger to the \\npublic health or welfare or the environment. \\n• CERCLA Section 101(33) defines “pollutant or contaminant” as including but not limited to “any \\nelement, substance, compound, or mixture, including disease -causing agents, which after release into the \\nenvironment and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation, or assimilation into any organism, either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through food chains, will or may reasonably be \\nanticipated to cause death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutation, physiological \\nmalfunctions (including malfunctions in reproduction) or physical deformations, in such organisms or \\ntheir offspring.” Substances meeting that definition may also be addressed under CERCLA. \\n \\nThe list of hazardous substances for CERCLA purposes (pursuant to CERCLA Section 102) is maintained in table \\n302.4 of 40 CFR part 302.4.\\n25 This table also notes the particular federal legislation under which each hazardous \\nsubstance is designated.  \\n \\nHRS Section 2.2.2, Identify hazardous substances associated with a source , gives instruction on associating \\nhazardous substances with a source, stating:  \\n \\nFor each of the three migration pathways, consider those hazardous substances documented in a source (for example, by sampling, labels, manifests, oral or written statements) to be associated \\nwith that source when evaluating each pathway. \\n Page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal explained  that hazardous substances are associated with \\nSource 1, Cominco Outfalls Slag. Page 33 stated that: \\n \\n[E]ffluent was not sampled by consultants for EPA. For this reason, hazardous substances listed \\nto be present in outfall effluent are documented by Cominco reports and from outfall releases reported to the B.C. Ministry of Environment, Lands, and Parks by Com inco. \\n \\nTABLE 1 – \\nCominco Smelter – Outfalls \\nHAZARDO US SUBSTANC ES \\nAnalyte Referen ce \\nArsenic Refs. 12, p. 17; 13, pp. 138-139  \\nCadmium Refs. 12, p. 17; 13, pp. 138-139  \\nCoppe r Refs. 11; 13, p. 138  \\nLead Refs. 11; 12, p. 17; 13, p. 140  \\nMercury Refs. 12, p. 17; 13, pp. 139-140  \\nZinc Refs. 11; 12, p. 17; 13, pp. 139-140  \\n In April 2010, a consultant for CCT collected a slag sample (SL4) from the UCR riverbed adjacent to the Cominco smelter… . \\n \\nTABLE 2 –  \\nAPRIL 2010 SLAG SAMPLE RESULTS (mg/kg)*  \\nSlag Sample \\nSL4  <0.063 mm  0.1777 -0.25 \\nmm 0.71-1 mm  1.41-2 mm  2.83-4 mm  Bagged \\nSample  \\nAntimony  93 17 17 7.9 7.2 7.8 \\nArsenic  580 170 160 110 64 86 \\nCadmium  140 73 73 3 2 33 \\n \\n25 The 40 CFR 302.4 list is available at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title -40/chapter -I/subchapter -J/part -302/section -302.4   Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 44  Chromium  41 34 54 59 58 49 \\nCopper  4,200  1,500  1,700  1,500  1,400  1,300  \\nLead  25,000  8,800  7,900  3,700  1,200  3,600  \\nMercury  8.4 0.39 0.086  0.075  0.041  0.088  \\nNickel  40 16 18 22 16 16 \\nSilver  39 11 8.2 5.7 2.6 4.7 \\nZinc  30,000  36,000  36,000  18,000  2,800  16,000  \\nmm = millimeter  \\nmg/kg = milligrams per kilogram  \\n*Ref. 18, p. 74  \\n \\nThus a ntimony, arsenic, cadmium , chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc were \\nassociated with Source 1. These substances are CERCLA hazardous substances based on their specific \\nlisting in the list of CERCLA hazardous substances. The 40 CFR Table 302.4 list of CERCLA hazardous substances includes antimony, arsenic, cadmium , chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and \\nzinc, and shows that each of these particular substances qualifies  as a CERCLA hazardous substance via \\nbeing listed as a t oxic pollutant under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and/or a hazardous air \\npollutant under the Clean Air Act (i.e., via CERCLA 101(14) subparts (D) and (E), respectively). These substances therefore qualify as CERCLA hazardous substances, meet the HRS definition of hazardous substance, and are eligible for HRS scoring. \\n \\nIn addition, the fact that slag \\n as a material does not qualify as a RCRA hazardous waste does not negate \\nthe CERCLA hazardous substance status of the metals in that slag. As noted above, the CERCLA \\ndefinition of hazardous substances includes those substances listed as RCRA hazardous was tes as a subset  \\nof substances that qualify as CERCLA hazardous substances, along with substances listed under the other statutes. Exclusion of a material under one of these statutes does not invalidate the inclusion of the same or related material on one of the other statute’s lists. The courts have understood that RCRA hazardous \\nwastes are only one subset of the broader list of CERCLA hazardous substances. See, e.g., Louisiana-\\nPacific Corp. v. ASARCO, Inc., 24 F.3d 1565, 1572-1573 (9th Cir. 1994); Eagle-Picher v. EPA, 759 F.2d \\n922, 926-931 (D.C.

TAI also stated that slag \\nis not a CERCLA hazardous substance and excluded from the definition of solid waste under 40 CFR 261.4. TAI \\nconcluded that the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity value was incorrectly estimated based on a volume of slag, \\nwhich is not a CERCLA hazardous substance.  \\n \\nResponse: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly assigned a hazardous waste quantity value for \\nSource 1 based on an evaluation of Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity. The HRS documentation record at proposal did not evaluate Tier A, hazardous constituent quantity, for Source 1 as implied by the commenter. \\n \\nH\\nRS Section 1.1, Definitions , defines a hazardous wastestream as “[m] aterial containing  CERCLA hazardous \\nsubstances (as defined in CERCLA section 101[14]) that was deposited, stored, disposed, or placed in, or that otherwise migrated to, a source .” \\n In providing instructions for the source hazardous waste quantity evaluation, HRS Section 2.4.2.1.2, Hazardous \\nwastestream quantity , states:  \\n \\nEvaluate hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) based on the mass of hazardous wastestreams plus the mass of any \\nadditional C ERCLA pollutants and contaminants (as defined in CERCLA section 101[33], as \\namended) that are allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure). For a wastestream that consists solely of a hazardous waste listed pursuant to section 3001 of RCRA, as amended or that consists solely of a RC RA hazardous waste that exhibits the \\ncharacteristics identified under section 3001 of RC RA, as amended, include the mass of that \\nentire hazardous waste in the evaluation of this measure.   \\nBased on this mass, designated as W, assign a value for hazardous wastestream quantity as \\nfollows: \\n• For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for hazardous wastestream quantity using the Tier B equation of Table 2–5…. \\nDo not evaluate the volume and area measures described below if the source is the unallocated source or if the following condition applies: \\n• The hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or \\narea of observed exposure) is adequately determined–that is, total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from \\nthe source (or for the area of observed contamination) is known or is estimated with \\nreasonable confidence…. \\nOtherwise, assign the source (or area of observed contamination) a value for hazardous \\nwastestream quantity based on the available data and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.3. \\n \\nHRS Section 2.4.2.1.5, Calculation of source hazardous waste quantity value , states:  \\n \\nSelect the highest of the values assigned to the source (or areas of observed contamination, areas \\nof observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination) for the hazardous constituent \\nquantity, hazardous wastestream quantity, volume, and area measures. \\n Page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal identified the hazardous substances associated with Source 1. As explained in section 3.19, Hazardous Substance Definition, of this support document, page 33 of the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal include d Tables 1 and 2 , which identify that a ntimony, arsenic, cadmium , \\nchromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc were associated with Source 1.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 46  As part of the discussion of the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity evaluation, page 34 of the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal stated that:  \\n \\nTherefore, there is insufficient information to evaluate the associated releases from the source to calculate the hazardous constituent quantity for Source 1 with reasonable confidence. As a result, \\nthe evaluation of hazardous waste quantity proceeds to the evaluation of Tier B , Hazardous \\nWastestream Quantity . \\n \\nIn discussing the scoring of Tier B, Hazardous Wastestream Quantity, pages 34 and 38 state d: \\n \\nReports that accurately document the yearly and daily amounts of tail slag released to the UCR from the Cominco smelter have not been located. Reports prepared by consultants to Cominco \\nstate that prior to 1995, slag was discharged to the UCR at an average yearly rate of 145,000 \\ntonnes or 159,836 tons (i.e., 145,000 tonnes / 0.90718 tonnes per 1 ton = 159,836 tons) and an \\naverage daily rate of 360 tonnes or 397 tons (i.e., 360 tonnes / 0.90718 tonnes per 1 ton = 397 \\ntons) [Ref. 13, p. 37; Ref. 53, p. 2]. The quantity of slag produced for each year of smelter operation can more accurately be calculated from lead production values. Cominco has reported \\nthat the amount of lead is directly related to the amount of slag produced using the following \\ninformation [R ef. 15, p. 2].  \\n \\nLead production x 140% = amount of blast furnace slag produced.  Amount of blast furnace slag produced x 85% = Amount of slag produced. For example:  \\n \\n- 151,492 tons of lead produced in 1930 x 140% = 212,088.8 tons of blast furnace slag \\n- 212,088.8 tons of blast furnace slag x 85% = 180,275.48 tons of slag produced in 1930 \\n \\nLead production values were obtained from Cominco annual reports [Ref. 3, pp. 3- 20]. Using this \\ninformation, it is estimated that 11,980,922.52 tons or 23,961,845,040 pounds (11,980,922.52 x 2,000 pounds per 1 ton) of tail slag were produced from the Cominco smelter and released to the \\nUCR over the course of operations from 1930 to 1994 as demonstrated in Table 3 below…  \\nBased on the report conducted by a consultant for CCT, it is estimated that 90 percent of the slag discharged to the UCR (between 1930 and 1994) was transported into the U.S. [Ref. 18, p. 5, 87, \\n89, 90]. The value assigned to hazardous wastestream quantity is calculated as follows:  \\n \\n23,961,845,040 pounds x 0.9 = 21,565,660,536 pounds  21,565,660,536 pounds / 5,000 = 4,313,132.10  \\nHazardous Wastestream Quantity (W) Value: 4,313,132.10  \\n[Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.2, Table 2-5] \\n Page 39 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed the source hazardous waste quantity value for \\nSource 1 and stated , “[t] he source hazardous waste quantity value for Source 1 is 4,313,132.10 for Tier B – \\nHazardous Wastestream Quantity .” \\n In calculating the hazardous waste quantity for Source 1, the hazardous wastestream quantity was evaluated and \\nnot the hazardous constituent quantity as implied by the commenter. Page 34 of the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal, quoted above, explained  that because insufficient information was available to calculate Tier A, \\nhazardous constituent quantity, the next tier, Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity , was evaluated instead.  \\n \\nAs described in HRS Section 2.4.2.1.1, Hazardous constituent quantity , t\\n he hazardous constituent quantity is the \\nHRS measure that involves just the mass of hazardous substances (i.e., it is “based solely on the mass of CERCLA  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 47  hazardous substances (as defined in CERCLA  section 101(14)” with some exceptions for certain RCRA wastes). \\nBy contrast, for HRS purposes, a hazardous wastestream  is defined as material that contains hazardous substances, \\nand the mass of that wastestream is the subject of this hazardous waste quantity measure. (See HRS Section \\n2.4.2.1.2, quoted above.) Slag is material containing hazardous substances that are eligible for HRS scoring, as explained in section 3.19, Hazardous Substance Definition, of this support document. Therefore, slag that has been \\nreleased from an outfall is consistent with the HRS definition of a hazardous wastestream.  \\n A\\ns these comments relate to the evaluation of the hazardous waste quantity, Tier B, the hazardous wastestream \\nquantity, was properly determined consistent with the HRS requirements. HRS Section 2.4.2.1.2 directs to \\ncalculate the mass of hazardous wastestreams and to assign a value for the hazardous wastestream quantity \\nregardless of whether it is completely or partially estimated. Using the available data for the mass of slag released (i.e., an HRS- eligible hazardous wastestream), a partial estimate of the mass of the wastestream from the outfall \\n(i.e., the slag) was calculated as 21,565,660,536 pounds. In this case, only the slag discharged to the river and transported to the U.S. part of the river was scored. As quoted above, after applying the divisor in HRS Table 2-5, \\na value of 4,313,132.10 was assigned as a partial estimate of the hazardous wastestream quantity. As directed in \\nHRS Section 2.4.2.1.2, because the “total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from the source” is not known or “estimated with reasonable confidence,” \\nthe evaluation proceeded to Tier C, Volume, in accordance with the HRS.  \\n Furthermore, although the HRS documentation record at proposal assigned the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity \\nvalue based on a partial Tier B (hazardous wastestream quantity) estimate, the Tier C (volume) estimate received the same value. As discussed on page 38 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal also evaluated Tier C, Volume, based on the volume of the slag discharged and carried to the \\nU.S. part of the river , which received the same estimated value of 4,313,132.10. \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  \\n3.21 Surface Water Migration Pathway \\nComment : TAI and three citizens submitted comments questioning aspects of the scoring of the surface water \\nmigration pathway.  \\n \\nResponse: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly scored the surface water migration pathway \\nconsistent with the HRS. Specific comments and responses are provided below in the following subsections:  \\n \\n• 3.21.1 C\\nontainment  \\n• 3.21.2 Attribution \\n• 3.21.3 Waste Characteristics \\n• 3.21.4 Human Food Chain Threat – Targets \\n \\n3.21.1  Containment  \\nComment: TAI and three citizens submitted comments related to containment of contamination. TAI asserted that \\nmetals are releasing from slag at slow rates as indicated by the few metals detected at concentrations above \\nbenchmarks. Two citizens commented that the metal contamination in the Upper Columbia River is buried \\nbeneath sediment. A citizen stated that metals are covered by sediment as indicated by the lack of contamination \\nin bottom feeding fish.  \\n \\nResponse :  Insomuch as these comments pertain to whether the contamination scored is contained, Sources 1, 2, \\nand 3 were determined to be uncontained for HRS scoring purposes. F or HRS scoring purposes, the containment Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 48  of contamination is generally measured at the source and is an evaluation of how well contained hazardous \\nsubstance- bearing source material is from escaping into the environment.  \\n In providing source containment instructions in the surface water migration pathway section, HRS Section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1, Containment , states:  \\n \\nDetermine the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:  \\n• If one or more sources is located in surface water in the watershed (for example, intact sealed drums in surface water), assign the containment factor a value of 10 for the  \\nwatershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1. \\n• If none of the sources is located in surface water in the watershed, assign a containment factor value from table 4 –2 to each source at the site that can potentially release \\nhazardous substances to the hazardous substance migration path for this watershed. \\nAssign the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:  \\n- Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources that meet the \\nminimum size requirement described below. Assign this highest value as the \\ncontainment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1. \\n- If, for this watershed, no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then \\nselect the highest containment factor value assigned to the sources at the site eligible \\nto be evaluated for this watershed and assign it as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1.  \\nA source meets the minimum size requirement if its source hazardous waste quantity value (see \\nsection 2.4.2.1.5) is 0.5 or more. Do not include the minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this surface water migration component, except po tential to release by flood as \\nspecified in section 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.  \\n \\nHRS Table 4 -2, Containment Factor Values for Surface Water Migration Pathway , states in relevant part:  \\n \\nTABLE 4 –2—CO NTAINMENT FACT OR VALUES FOR SURF ACE  WATER \\nMIGRAT ION PATHWAY \\nSource Assigned \\nvalue \\nAll Sources (Except Surface Impoundments, Land Treatment, Containers, and \\nTanks)   \\nEvidence of hazardous substance migration from source areas (i.e., source area \\nincludes source and any associated containment structures) 10  \\nNo evidence of hazardous substance migration from source area and:   \\n(a) Neither of the following present (1) maintained engineer cover, or (2) \\nfunctioning and m aintained run-on control system and runoff management \\nsystem  10  \\n(b) Any one of the two items in (a) present. 9  \\n(c) Any two the following pr esent (1) maintained engineer cover, or (2) \\nfunctioning and m aintained run-on control system and runoff management \\nsystem, or (3) liner with functioning leachate collection and removal system \\nimmediately above liner.  7  \\n(d) All items in (c) present  5  \\n(e) (All items in (c) present, plus no bu lk or non-containerized liquids nor \\nmaterials containing free liquids deposited in source area.  3  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 49  No evidence of hazardous substance migration from source area, double liner with \\nfunctioning leachate collection and removal system above and between liners, and:   \\n(f) Only one of the following deficiencies in containment: (1) bulk or \\nnoncontainerized liquids or materials containing free liquids deposited in \\nsource areas, or (2) no or nonfunctioning or nonmaintained run-on control \\nsystem and runoff management system,  or (3) no or nonmaintained \\nengineered cover.  3  \\n(g) None of the deficiencies in (f) present  \\nSource area inside or under maintained intact structure that provides protection \\nfrom precipitation so that neither runoff nor leachate is generated, liquids or materials containing free liquids not deposited in source area, and functioning \\nand maintain ru n-on control present.  0  \\n \\nIn discussing Source 1, page 32 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  \\n \\nContainment \\n Release to surface water via overland migration:  \\nThe source consists of outfalls that discharged effluent and slag directly to the Columbia River \\n[Ref. 4, p. 26]. A surface water containment value of 10 is assigned based on evidence of \\nhazardous substance migration from the source to the UCR [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. \\n \\nRelease to surface water via flood:  \\n The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it \\ndoes not affect the listing decision. \\n \\nIn discussing Source 2, page 40 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  \\n \\nContainment \\n Release to surface water via overland migration: The source consists of exposed contaminated \\nsoil which does not have a maintained engineered cover or a functioning and maintained run-on \\ncontrol system and runoff management system [Refs. 5, p. 791-792; 38, pp. 68-69, 94; 57, p. 2]. A surface water containment factor value of 10 is assigned [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. \\n Release to surface water via flood:  \\n The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it does not affect the listing decision. \\n In discussing Source 3, pages 46 -47 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated :  \\n \\nContainment  \\n \\nRelease to surface water via overland migration: The source consists of sluice boxes which \\ndischarged slag directly to the UCR. This source does not have a maintained engineered cover or \\na functioning and maintained run-on control system and runoff management system [Refs. 4, pp. \\n22-24; 5, pp. 780-782; 46, pp. 9-10]. During RI activities conducted by a contractor of the \\nWashington State Department of Ecology in 2019, slag was observed in 101 of 138 samples \\nsampled along the UCR waterfront. Most of the obser ved slag was either granular or mixed Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 50  granular and clinker [Ref. 37, pp. 10, 36-38]. Based on this information and the direct discharge \\nto the UCR (evidence of hazardous substance migration from the source to the UCR), a surface \\nwater containment factor value of 10 is assigned [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. \\n \\nRelease to surface water via flood:  \\n The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it \\ndoes not affect the listing decision. \\n \\nSource 1 (Cominco outfalls slag), Source 2 (contaminated soil), and Source 3 (Le Roi sluice boxes discharge) \\nwere assigned containment factor values of 10 because of evidence of hazardous substance migration and/or a \\nlack of containment features  as quoted above. As indicated in the HRS, quoted above, hazardous substances \\nassociated with a source with a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 are considered available to the watershed and included in the Site score because these sourc es are not fully contained. As all three sources \\nwere assigned containment factor values of 10 based on source-specific conditions, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly established that each source is uncontained and the associated contamination, including the Cominco outfalls slag (Source 1) and the Le Roi sluice boxes discharge (Source 3), is available to \\nthe watershed and the surface water migration pathway. For source material that has already migrated into a \\npathway medium— i.e., slag in surface water  sediments for the Site— the HRS scoring factors for the surface \\nwater migration pathway do not consider such characteristics as the rate of hazardous substance leaching from source materials in sediments into the aqueous phase of the water body or sediment cover of the contaminants.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n3.21.2  Attribution  \\nComment: TAI submitted comments discussing other possible contributors to the contamination scored. TAI \\nasserted that the Other Possible Sources Not Scored section of the HRS documentation record at proposal is \\nincomplete because it does not discuss other possible origins of contamination.  \\n \\nResponse: The Other Possible Sources Not Scored section of the HRS documentation record wa s intended to \\nprovide discussion of other possible sources associated  with the site being scored (i.e., releases from Cominco \\nsmelter and Le Roi smelter) , as opposed to other non- site-related  sources. Insomuch as these comments relate to \\nthe consideration of other possible non- site-related contributors of contamination (contributors other than the \\nreleases from Cominco smelter and Le Roi smelter) in determining appropr iate attribution of the releases scored, \\nsuch contributors were discussed in the Attribution section of the HRS documentation record at proposal, and \\nattribution of the significant increase of hazardous substances to the Site, at l east in part, was properly \\ndocumented for the purpose of scoring an observed release by chemical analysis to surface water.  \\n In presenting the requirements for an observed release by chemical analysis, HRS Section 4.1.2.1.1, Observed \\nRelease, states, in relevant part:  \\n \\nEstablish an observed release to surface water for a watershed by demonstrating that the site has \\nreleased a hazardous substance to the surface water in the watershed. Base this demonstration on \\neither:  \\n• Direct observation .… \\n• Chemical analysis:  \\n- Analysis of surface water, benthi c, or sediment samples indicates that the \\nconcentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the \\nbackground concentration for the site for that type of sample (see section 2.3)…. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 51  • Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to \\nestablish the observed release, except: when the site itself consists of contaminated sediments with no identified source, no separate attribution is required. [emphasis \\nadded] \\n \\nIn describing other possibles sources associated with the Upper Columbia River site (i.e., related to the Cominco \\nsmelter and Le Roi smelter) that were not scored as sources, page 52 of the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal state d:  \\n \\nOther Possible Sources Not Scored  \\n \\nCominco Smelter – Fertilizer Outfall Effluent Discharge  - Fertilizer plants were built at the Trail \\nsmelter in 1930, facilitating the production of both nitrogen- and phosphorous- based fertilizers. \\nOne of the five outfalls associated with the Cominco smelter (i.e., Sewer IV) was used for the fertilizer operati on, which discharged effluent to the UCR. A trend graph of metals in effluents \\nfrom the metallurgical operation from 1980 to 1996 demonstrates that fertilizer plant operation contributed to an average effluent discharge up to 4 kg/d of total mercury and 350 kg/d of dissolved zinc [Refs. 4, pp. 25, 26; 9, pp. 6, 24; 12, p. 18]. The outfall discharge associated with \\nthe fertilizer operation was not scored in this HRS documentation record because the current \\nsurface water m igration pathway score has a maximum pathway score of 100.  \\n This section wa s not intended to address non- site sources unrelated to the Cominco smelter and Le Roi smelter. \\nInstead , the HRS documentation record at proposal described the rationale used to assess attribution for the \\nobserved release in the surface water migration pathway on pages 77 -81. Th is Attribution section  include s on \\npages 78-81 a subsection , Other  Possible Sites, w hich discusses possible contributions of other sources not related \\nto the Site. The Attribution section states:  \\n \\nAttribution  \\n Analytical results from sediment samples collected in September and October 2019 by \\nconsultants of Teck as part of a Phase 3 sediment study document an observed release by \\nchemical analysis to the UCR. The UCR is contaminated with heavy metals from the U.S . Canada \\nborder to RM 708 near Marcus, Washington, an approximate 35- mile stretch of river [see Section \\n4.1.2.1.1 of this HRS documentation record]. Although sediment samples were collected from three areas of concern which are several miles apart, contami nation does exist between these \\nareas. A Phase 2 Sediment study was previously conducted by a consultant of Teck and when this sediment data is combined with the Phase 3 data, the 35 -mile stretch encompassing the zone of \\ncontamination exhibits nearly conti nuous contamination [Ref. 66, pp. 3-162]. Sources associated \\nwith each smelter included in this HRS documentation record [see Section 2.2 of this HRS \\ndocumentation record] have contributed to commingling of metals contamination in the UCR [see \\nSection 4.1.2.1.1 of this HRS documentation record] and impact the targets on the UCR including \\nfisheries, wetlands, and a Federal- designated threatened species habitat [Sections 4.1.3.3.1, \\n4.1.3.3.2.2, and 4.1.4.3.1.2 of this HRS documentation record].  \\n Previous sediment investigations within the UCR have also documented contamination to the \\nUCR from sources associated with both smelters. In 2001, consultants for EPA conducted an \\nexpanded site inspection (ESI) of the UCR.... Analytical results from this investigation indicated \\nwidespread contamination in lake and river sediments throughout the UCR between Inchelium, \\nWashington and the U.S.- Canada border. Arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc \\nwere detected at conc entrations significantly above background sample concentrations, which \\nwere collected from Lower Arrow Lake by the Washington State Department of Ecology [Ref. 4, pp. 66, 71-85]. During this investigation, several sediment samples collected from the UCR Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 52  consisted of a visibly dark glassy sandy mixture characterized by EPA field personnel as slag \\n[Ref. 4, p. 93]. The ESI sampling program also included the collection of sediment samples from \\nthe mouths of 110 tributaries located along the UCR to determine other potential sources of \\ncontamination. Analytical results from tributary samples did not indicate the presence of elevated \\ncontaminants of interest indicative of major watershed sources of contamination [Refs. 4, pp. \\n165-217, 226- 227; 17, pp. 62- 63]. \\n Source 1 (i.e., Cominco Outfalls Slag) is located approximately 10 RMs upstream of the U.S.-\\nCanada border and was scored based on an observed release by direct observation from outfalls \\nthat discharge effluent  and slag contaminated with metals directly to the UCR [see Source 1 \\ndiscussion Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation record]. Although the most upstream scored \\nobserved release sample is located at Deadman’s Eddy, approximately 17 RMs downstream of \\nthe Cominco outfalls, contamination of the UCR does exist between the Cominco facility and the \\nmost upstream scored observed release sample located in Deadman’s Eddy… In 2010, a \\nconsultant for CCT collected sediment samples from the UCR at locations both upstream and \\ndownstream of the Cominco outfalls. Analytical results of sediment samples collected during this investigation indicates that concentrations of these metals increased markedly downstream \\n(compared to sediment samples collected upstream) of the Cominco smelter and remained at \\nelevated levels at four U.S. sampling sites across the U.S. border; the most downstream sample being collected upstream of the Le Roi smelter. Background sediment samples were collected \\nupstream of the Cominco smelter in Genelle and just downstream of the Keenleyside Dam [Ref. \\n18, pp. 58, 72, 74]. In addition, analytical results of a slag sample collected near the Cominco \\nsmelter indicated the presence of metals including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, \\ncopper, lead, nickel, zinc, and mercury [see Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. \\n18, pp. 36, 58, 63, 74].  \\n \\nFrom the Cominco smelter outfalls, metals contamination extends downstream along the UCR \\nwhere it comingles with releases associated with the Le Roi smelter. In 1897, the Le Roi smelter \\nbegan refining copper, lead, and silver ores from mines in northeast W ashington, as well as \\ncopper ore from British Columbia, Canada [Ref. 5, p, 104] …. The smelter was closed and \\ndismantled in 1922, after 24 years of sporadic operation [Ref. 5, p. 105]. During its operation, \\nslag was discharged from the furnaces at the Le Ro i smelter directly into the UCR via \\nunderground waterways, also referred to as sluice boxes (i.e., Source 3) …. Facility maps from \\n1901 and 1908 depict five underground waterways (sluice boxes, grouped as three passage areas) \\ntransporting slag from furnaces to discharge points on the UCR [Refs. 4, p. 24; 46, pp. 9- 10].  \\n \\nIn 2019, an RI of the Northport Waterfront was conducted by a consultant of the Washington \\nState Department of Ecology …. During this investigation, slag materials, (as both clinker and \\nfine granulated particles) were noted to be widespread on the beach, the hillside leading to the UCR as well as in the UCR [Ref. 37, pp. 6, 7, 36- 38]…. \\n \\nThe presence of slag along the shores of the UCR has been documented from Trail B.C., the \\nlocation of the Cominco smelter, to RM 708 in Washington State indicating Cominco and Le Roi \\nsmelters as the sources for this contamination [see Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation \\nrecord].  \\n \\nMetals associated with Cominco smelter and the Le Roi smelter sources were detected at \\nconcentrations significantly above those concentrations detected in background sediment \\nsamples; therefore, at least some portion of the significant increase of these me tals in observed \\nrelease samples in the UCR is attributable to a release from sources associated with both smelters [Table 11; Table 13 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 1, Section 4.1.2.1.1].  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 53  Other Possible Sites  \\n \\nIn addition to contamination from sources (associated with the two smelters) scored in this \\nHRS evaluation, other potential sources of hazardous substances that may have contributed to contamination include mining and milling operations and pulp and paper production [see \\nFigures 2 -1 and 5 of this HRS documentation record]. These contaminant sources are \\nsummarized in the following paragraphs. [emphasis added ] \\n \\nCelgar Pulp Mill - The Celgar Pulp Company (Celgar ) bleach kraft pulp mill is an additional \\nsource of hazardous substance contamination to the Columbia River, however, it is not included \\nas a source in this HRS documentation record since this document has been limited to sources of \\ninorganic contamination and the Celgar mill is instead a source of dioxin/furan contamination. \\nThe Celgar mill is in Castlegar, B.C., approximately 30 RMs upstream from the U.S.- Canada \\nborder [ Figure 2 -1 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 22, p. 20]. From 1961 until mid-1993, \\nthe mill primarily used chlorine in its bleaching process [Ref. 4, p. 31]. The pulp mill discharged \\neffluent containing chlorinated organic compounds, including dioxins and furans, into the Columbia River [Ref. 4, p. 31]. \\n \\nBonanza Mill  - The Bonanza Mill is located approximately 3 miles northwest of Colville, \\nWashington, on the Colville River, a tributary of the Columbia River. The site is a former lead and zinc mill that operated from 1885 to 1952 [Ref. 7, p. 8, 9]. The facility contained a 100-ton flotation mill that processed ore using amalgamation, leaching, and/or flocculation, each of which \\nutilized inorganic elements including mercury [Ref. 7, p. 8]. As a result of milling activities, \\napproximately 17,500 cubic yards o f tailings and waste rock were spread across the facility [Ref. \\n7, p. 11]. Analytical results of tailings/waste rock samples indicate the presence of significant concentrations of arsenic, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 7, pp. 30-31 (Table 6-1)]. Further, analytical results of sediment samples collected \\nfrom the Colville River indicate the presence of lead at an elevated concentration and analytical \\nresults of sediment samples collected from on -site ditches draining to the Colville River indicate \\nthe presence of elevated concentrations of arsenic, barium, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 7, pp. 19, 89, 91- 92, 94, and 95]. After these sampling efforts, consultants \\nfor the EPA conducted a removal action at the facility which included placing 12 to 18 inches of \\neither rock or clay barrier over exposed contaminated mine wastes [Ref. 47, pp. 3, 4]. The \\nBonanza Mill is not believed to be a source of the zone of contamination as scored in thi s HRS \\ndocumentation record, as the Colville River discharges to the UCR downstream of the zone of contamination [Ref. 7, pp. 34, 36]. \\n \\nYoung America Mine/Mill  – The Young America Mine is located approximately 3.6 miles \\nnorthwest of Evans and is accessible from Highway 25 via Hutson Jones Way [Ref. 59, p. 5]…. \\nThe mine portion is located on the eastern side of Highway 25 and is located on land managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The mill and tailings impoundment portion of the \\nsite is located on four privately -owned parcels west of Highway 25 near the UCR. The mine \\noperated between 1897 and 1953, mining zinc, lead, silver, and gold. The flotation mill was built \\n(by Gregor Mines, Inc.) in the late 1940s and operated from 1948 to 1954. Tailings resulting from \\nthe mining operations were discharged downhill towards the west into an impoundment area \\nlocated in the mill portion of  the site …. Laboratory analyses from soil samples collected from the \\nmine and mill portions of the site indicated the presence of lead, arsenic, cadmium, and manganese above EPA Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) [Ref. 59, p. 9]. In 2012, EPA conducted a TCR A to consolidate and cap contaminated soil and tailings in the area around and \\nbelow the mill buildings. Mill buildings were crushed in place, the existing cap was removed on the impoundment and the tailings and contaminated soil were capped with a liner and local \\nmaterial. The TCRA was completed on November 3, 2012 [Refs. 60, p. 2; 61, p. 2]. In the 2021 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 54  HHRA conducted by EPA, it was determined that there was no evidence that contamination \\nmoved down-river from the Young America Mine mill impoundment [Ref. 17, p. 62].  \\n \\nHahnlen Property – The Hahnlen Property is located approximately 3.6 miles northeast of Evans, \\nWA on the east side of Highway 25. The UCR shoreline is located approximately 800 feet west of the property…. Approximately 31,568 square feet of lead- contaminated soil was covered with \\na liner; clean soil from a nearby source was placed on the liner Ref. 58, p. 14].  \\n \\nMines and Mills – Stevens County, Washington  \\n In 2001, EPA conducted PA/SI investigations at 39 mines and mills in Stevens County, \\nWashington. In addition to the Le Roi smelter, four sites were recommended for further action \\nunder CERCLA; an additional site (Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill) was later recommended for further \\naction under CERCLA [Ref. 30, p. 1]. These sites are summarized below: \\n \\nAnderson Calhoun Mine/Mill  \\n The Anderson Calhoun Mine/Mill is located 1 mile north of Leadpoint, Washington, on the west \\nside of Deep Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River [5, pp. 136- 137]. The mine/mill is a former \\nlead and zinc mine/mill that is reported to have been in operation from 1948 to 1952 [Ref. 5, p. 136]. The mine/mill contains a tailings pile measuring 555 feet by 500 feet by an unknown depth, a waste rock pile measuring 120 feet by 80 feet by 20 feet deep, an evaporation pond measuring \\n105 feet by 50 feet, and a mine pit measuring 100 feet by 50 feet [Ref. 5, pp. 6-136, 139]. \\nAnalytical results documented significant concentrations of copper and mercury in the tailings \\npile. Lead and zinc were detected in water from the mine pit [Ref. 5, p. 140]. EPA removal action \\nactivities occurred at the site in 2010 [Ref. 17, p. 68]. The Anderson Calhoun Mine/Mill is not \\nbelieved to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample \\n(TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not \\nexhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215- 216, 227, 451].  \\n \\nLast Chance Mine/Mill  \\n \\nThe Last Chance Mine/Mill is located approximately 5 miles southeast of Northport, Washington, \\nnear Deep Creek, a tributary of the UCR. The facility is a former lead, silver, and zinc mine/mill \\nthat produced 5,937,708 pounds of lead; 18,567 pounds of silver and 110,110 pounds of zinc \\nbetween 1904-1954 [Ref. 5, pp. 30, 114] …. Analytical results of waste rock samples indicate the \\npresence of significant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, thallium, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. \\n175 (Table 6-13), 176, 235 (Figur e 6-24)]. A tailings pile is also present at the facility [Ref. 5, p. \\n115]…. Analytical results of tailings samples indicate the presence of significant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, p. 175 (Table 6-13), 176, 235 (Figure 6-24)]. \\nFurther, an unnamed intermittent creek passes through one of the waste rock piles and the tailings pile as it flows toward Deep Creek [Ref. 5, p. 235 (Figure 6- 24)]. The Last Chance Mine/Mill is \\nnot believed to be a source of contamination to the UCR, a s analytical results from a tributary \\nsample (TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not exhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215-216, 227, 451]. \\n \\nL-Bar/Northwest Magnesite \\n L-Bar/Northwest Magnesite facility is located approximately two miles south of Chewelah, \\nWashington, on the south bank of the Colville River, a tributary of the UCR. The facility is a \\nformer magnesite plant that opened in 1916 and closed in 1968. In the mid-1970s, the facility was \\nconverted to recover magnesium from a magnesium processing byproduct commonly referred to Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 55  as flux bar. The magnesium recovery facility was closed in 1991 [Ref. 5, p. 78]. It has been \\ndemonstrated that flux bar and flux bar residue materials are sources of ammonia and chloride \\n[Ref. 5, p.79]…. The L -Bar/Northwest Magnesite site is not believed to be a source of the zone of \\ncontamination as scored in this HRS documentation record, as the Colville River discharges to \\nthe UCR downstream of the zone of contamination [Ref. 5,pp. 258, 299]. \\n \\nVan Stone Mine/Mill  \\n \\nThe Van Stone Mine/Mill is located approximately 11 miles south of Northport, Washington, on Onion Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River. The facility is a former cadmium, lead, and zinc \\nmine/mill that contains two tailings piles, a waste rock storage area, an open pit, a seepage pond, \\nand stained soil areas [Ref. 5, pp. 94, 96]; Tailings from ore processing were slurried via a \\nwooden flume to pile locations [Ref. 5, p. 95].… Analytical results of tailings samples indicate \\nthe presence of significant con centrations of lead, manganese, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 160-\\n165 (Table 6- 6), 166]. Analytical results of waste rock samples indicate the presence of \\nsignificant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 158-160 (Table 6- 6), \\n166]. Several unnamed creeks flow through the facility grounds to Onion Creek [Ref. 5, pp. 221 \\n(Figure 6 -13), 223 (Figure 6-14), and 262]. Surface water runoff from the tailings piles and the \\nwaste rock area drains to these unnamed creeks [Ref. 5, pp. 221 (Fi gure 6 -13), 262, 223 (Figure \\n6-14)]. Analytical results of a sediment sample collected at the probable point of entry from one \\nof the tailings piles to an adjacent unnamed creek indicate the presence of elevated concentrations of lead and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 167 (Table 6-7), 168 and 223 (Figure 6-14)]. The Van Stone \\nMine/Mill underwent a removal action in 2017 [Ref. 17, p. 68].  The Van Stone Mine/Mill is not \\nbelieved to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample \\n(TS099) collected from Onion Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not \\nexhibit significant concentrati ons of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 213- 214, 227, 450].  \\n \\nSierra Zinc Mine/Mill  \\n \\nThe Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill is located approximately 17 miles south of Northport, Washington, on \\nthe west side of Deep Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River. The mine/mill is a former gold, lead, silver, and zinc mine/mill that operated sporadically from 1909 to 1952 [Ref. 5, pp. 30, \\n124]. The mine/mill contains a tailings pile measuring 1,000 feet by 2,100 feet by approximately 20 feet deep and a waste rock pile measuring 100 feet by 50 feet by 5 feet deep [Ref. 5, pp. 124-\\n125]. Analytical results document significant concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, \\nand zinc in both the tailings pile and the waste rock pile [Ref. 5, p. 126]. The Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill underwent removal actions in 2001 and 2002 [Ref. 17, pp. 67-68]. The Sierra Zinc \\nMine/Mill underwent a removal action in 2017 [Ref. 17, p. 68]. The Van Stone Mine/Mill is not \\nbelieved to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample \\n(TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not \\nexhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215- 216, 227, 451].  \\n \\nMines and Mills – Pend Oreille County, Washington  \\n \\nIn 2001-2002, EPA conducted PA/SI investigations at 21 mines and mills in Pend Oreille County, \\nWashington. During this investigation, a total of five sites were recommended for further action \\nunder CERCLA. Three of the sites have since had their status changed to no further remedial \\naction planned (NFRAP) [Ref. 31, p. 1]. The remaining sites are summarized below:   \\nJosephine Mine  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 56  The Josephine Mine is a former zinc, lead, silver, and cadmium mine located in the Metaline \\nmining district. The mine area consisted of a shaft, a waste rock pile, a small building, and \\ncollapsing wood structure. The mine is located directly across the Pend Oreille River from the \\nPend Oreille Mine/Mill. Analytical results of a sediment sample at the probable point of entry of a waste rock pile to the Pend Oreille River documented significant concentrations of cadmium, \\nlead, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 6, pp. 50-53, 133]. The Josephine Mine underwent a removal \\naction; the site was deemed to have localized contaminant concentrations that met EPA requirements for a removal action; however, the Josephine Mine was not identified as a source of \\ncontamination to the UCR site [Ref. 17, p. 62].   \\nGrandview Mine/Mill  \\n \\nThe Grandview Mine/Mill is located in the lower Pend Oreille River Valley, approximately 0.75 \\nmile from the east bank of the Pend Oreille River, approximately 2 miles northeast of Metaline \\nFalls, Washington. Source areas identified on site included a taili ngs pile, waste rock piles, and an \\nabandoned container and drum area. Analytical results from sampling events conducted in 2000 \\nand 2001 indicated that the Grandview Mine/Mill is a source of hazardous substance \\ncontamination to groundwater drinking water wells, an unnamed spring, a former wastewater \\nditch, and the Pend Oreille River. Contaminants detected at elevated concentrations in a sediment \\nsample collected from the Pend Oreille River included cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc [Ref. 6, \\npp. 52-53, 134-135]. The Grandview Mine/Mill underwent a removal action; the site was deemed \\nto have localized contaminant concentrations that met EPA requirements for a removal action; \\nhowever, the Grandview Mine/Mill was not identified as a source of contamination to the UCR \\nsite [Ref. 17, p. 62]. \\n \\nThus, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly established that the observed release by chemical analysis to surface water was attributable, at least in part, to the Site, and included discussion of other non- site-\\nrelated possible contributors to the contamination. ( The significant increase in hazardous substances compared to \\nthe background level was not challenged by the commenter.) The 11 other possible sites that were identified \\nduring the HRS evaluation were used to help determine that the observed release was attributable, at least in part, \\nto the site as discussed in the Attribution section on pages 77-81 of the HRS documentation record at proposal \\nquoted above.  \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n 3.21.3  Waste Characteristics  \\nComment : TAI stated that the w aste c haracteristics f actor category value, in conjunction with the hazardous waste \\nquantity and t oxicity/persistence /bioaccumulation  factor values, was used to determine a maximum human food \\nchain threat score that likely overestimates the risk posed by the Site. TAI commented that this approach is \\ninconsistent with Site conditions and is not supported by RI/FS data.  \\n TAI commented that the metals in the historically released slag have limited bioavailability. TAI asserted that the \\nslow release rates of metals from slag are evident at the Site, as indicated by the low concentrations of metals in \\nsurface water from the Upper Columbia River.  \\n \\nResponse : The waste characteristics factor category value was correctly calculated in accordance with the HRS in \\nthe HRS documentation record at proposal. The related factor values (i.e., the hazardous waste quantity factor value, toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation) used in the waste characteristics factor category value calculation were also properly assigned in the HRS documentation record at proposal.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 57  In discussing the procedure to evaluate the human food chain threat waste characteristics, HRS Section 4.1.3.2, \\nHuman food chain threat -waste characteristics, states to “[e]valuate the waste characteristics factor category for \\neach watershed based on two factors: toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation and hazardous waste quantity.”  \\n HRS Section 4.1.3.2.2, Hazardous waste quantity , instructs to “[a] ssign  the same factor value for hazardous waste  \\nquantity for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.1.2.2.2 for the drinking water threat. ” HRS Section, \\n4.1.2.2.2, Hazardous waste quantity , in turn states to “[a] ssign a  hazardous waste quantity factor value for  the \\nwatershed as specified in section 2.4.2.” HRS Section 2.4.2, Hazardous waste quantity , in relevant part at 2.4.2.2, \\nstates:   \\n \\nSum the source hazardous  waste quantity values assigned to all sources (including the unallocated \\nsource) or areas  of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface \\ncontamination  for the pathway being evaluated and round this sum to the nearest integer, except:  \\nIf the sum is greater than 0, but less  than 1, round it to 1. Based on this value, select  a hazardous \\nwaste quantity factor value for the pathway from Table 2–6.  \\n \\nTABLE 2 –6—HAZARDOUS WASTE QUANTITY FACTOR VALUES  \\n \\nHazardous waste quantity value  Assigned  \\nvalue  \\n0 0 \\n1a to 100  b1 \\nGreater than 100 to 10,000  100 \\nGreater than 10,000 to 1,000,000  10,000  \\nGreater than 1,000,000  1,000,000  \\na If the hazardous waste quantity value is greater than 0,  but less than 1, round it to 1 as specified \\nin text.  \\nb For the pathway, if hazardous constituent quantity is not  adequately determined, assign a value \\nas specified in the text; do not assign the value of 1.  \\n \\nHRS Section 4.1.3.2.1.4, Calculation of toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value , states how the \\nbioaccumulation potential factor value is used to determine the toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value \\nfor a hazardous substance:  \\n \\nAssign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence factor value from Table 4 –12, based on \\nthe values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and persistence factors. Then assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value from Table 4–16, based on the values assigned for the toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation potential \\nfactors. Use the hazardous substance with the highest toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed to assign the value to this factor. Enter this value in Table 4–1.  \\n HRS Section 4.1.3.2.3, Calculation of human food chain threat -waste characteristics factor category value, \\ndescribes how a bioaccumulation potential factor value is used to calculate a human food chain threat -waste \\ncharacteristics factor category for the watershed:  \\n \\nFor the hazardous substance selected for the watershed in section 4.1.3.2.1.4, use its toxicity/persistence factor value and bioaccumulation potential factor value as follows to assign a \\nvalue to the waste characteristics factor category. First, multiply t he toxicity/persistence factor \\nvalue and the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1x10\\n8. Then multiply this product by the bioaccumulation potential factor value for \\nthis hazardous substance, subject to a  maximum product of 1x1012. Based on this second product, Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 58  assign a value from Table 2 –7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the human food chain threat- waste \\ncharacteristics factor category for the watershed.

However, the HRS states that if any target is subject to Level I or Level II concentrations, assign either the value for Table 2 -6 or a value of 100, whichever is greater, as \\nthe hazardous waste quantity factor value for that pathway [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.2]. Therefore, a hazardous waste quantity factor value of 1,000,000 is assigned for the surface water migration \\npathway.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 59  Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value: 1,000,000  \\n[Ref. 1, Table 2 -6] \\n \\nPage 83 of the HRS documentation record at proposal present ed the waste characteristics factor category value \\ncalculation and stated: \\n \\n4.1.3.2.3 Waste Characteristics Factor Category Value  \\n \\nMercury and cadmium are documented in observed releases and associated with Sources 1, 2, and \\n3, which have a surface water pathway containment factor value greater than 0 for the watershed \\nand correspond to a toxicity/persistence factor value of 10,000 and bioaccumulation potential \\nfactor value of 50,000, as shown above [Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.1.4; 2, pp. 12, 32].  \\n \\n(Toxicity/Persistence Factor Value) x (Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value) =  \\n10,000 x 1,000,000 = 1 x 1010  \\n(Subject to a maximum of 1 x 108)  \\n[Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.3]  \\n \\n(Toxicity/Persistence Factor Value x Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value) x  \\n(Bioaccumulation Potential Factor Value) = (1 x 108) x (50,000) = 5 x 1012  \\n(Subject to a maximum of 1 x 1012)  \\n[Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.3]  \\n \\nThe resulting waste characteristics product of 1 x 1012 corresponds to a Waste Characteristics \\nFactor Category Value of 1,000 in Table 2-7 of the HRS [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.3.1]. \\n \\nThus, the HRS documentation record at proposal evaluated each of the related factor values (i.e., toxicity, \\npersistence, bioaccumulation, and hazardous waste quantity factor values) to determine the waste characteristics factor category value consistent with the HRS. The hazardous waste quantity factor value was based on the \\ncombined sum of the Sources 1 -3 hazardous waste quantity values and HRS Table 2- 6 as presented above in the \\nquoted text from page 82 of the HRS documentation record at proposal. The tox icity, persistence, and \\nbioaccumulation factor values were determined based on an eligible hazardous substance as presented on page 82 \\nof the HRS documentation record at proposal, quoted above. As noted on page 83 of the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal, mercury and cadmium were determined to be the highest scoring hazardous substances with \\nidentical values for toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation. These values associated with mercury and  cadmium \\nwere used to calculate the waste characteristics fact or category value (i.e., 5 x 10\\n12, subject to a maximum of 1 x \\n1012) in accordance with the HRS as presented in calculations on page 83 of the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal.   \\nRegarding the bioavailability of metals in sediments,  the HRS does not consider the bioavailability of hazardous \\nsubstances in an HRS evaluation. \\n \\nRegarding the rate of release of metals from slag to water, for source material that has already migrated into a \\npathway medium— i.e., slag in surface water sediments for the Site— the HRS scoring factors for the surface \\nwater migration pathway do not consider this  rate. That is, HRS scoring does not consider the rate that metals \\nfrom waste material in sediment might dissolve into the water. Therefore, t his type of leaching process is  not \\nconsidered in the HRS site score.  \\n As these comments relate to the risk posed by the Site, please see section 3.15, Risk to Human Health or the \\nEnvironment, of this support document for the discussion of site- related risk.  \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n60 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n3.21.4  H\\numan Food Chain Threat - Targets  \\nComment: TAI provided comments discussing the level of contamination in fish. TAI commented that a \\nmisleading statement27 is present in the HRS documentation record at proposal that misidentifies the author28 of a \\nfish consumption Technical Summary. TAI asserted that while an advisory acknowledges contamination, the EPA \\ndetermined that fish from the Columbia River are generally safe for consumption. TAI commented that low levels \\nof lead are present in fish species except for largescale suckers, which are not widely consumed. TAI also stated \\nthat hazardous substances unrelated to the Site may be the driver behind fish advisories in place for sensitive groups.  \\nResponse : Insomuch as these comments question the scoring of the human food chain threat of the HRS  and the \\npresence of a human food chain fishery, fishing for human consumption within the zone of actual contamination was sufficiently documented to score the human food chain threat.  \\nHRS\\n Section 4.1.3.3, Human food chain threat- targets, provides instructions for evaluating targets in the \\nhuman food chain threat and states in relevant part:  \\nEval\\nuate two target factors for each watershed: food chain individual and population. For both \\nfactors, determine whether the target fisheries are subject to actual or potential human food chain \\ncontamination. \\nConsider a fishery (or portion of a fishery) within the target distance limit of the watershed to be \\nsubject to actual human food chain contamination if any of the following apply: \\n•A hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater\\nis present either in an observed release by direct observation to the watershed or in a\\nsurface water or sediment sample from the watershed at a level that meets the cr iteria for\\nan observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is\\nwithin the boundaries of the observed release (that is, it is located either at the point of\\ndirect observation or at or between the probable point of e ntry and the most distant\\nsampling point establishing the observed release)….  \\nWhen a fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to actual food chain contamination, determine \\nthe part of the fishery subject to Level I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations. If the actual food chain contamination is based on direct observation, evaluate it \\nusing Level II concentrations. However, if the actual food chain contamination is based on \\nsamples from the watershed, use these samples and, if available, additional tissue samples from \\naquatic human food chain organisms as specified below, to determine the part subject to Level I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations: \\n•Determine the level of actual contamination from samples (including tissue samples from\\nessentially sessile, benthic organisms) that meet the criteria for actual food chain\\ncontamination by comparing the exposure concentrations (see section 4.1.2.3) from these\\nsamples (or comparable samples) to the health -based benchmarks from table 4 -17, as\\ndescribed in section 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use only the exposure concentrations for those\\n27 TAI referred to page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, pointing to the following statement, “[a] WSDH fish \\nconsumption advisory Technical Summary (d ated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a primary source  of metals and \\nother chemical contaminants in the UCR [Ref. 52, p. 1].” \\n28 TAI asserted  that the referen ce document identifies the EPA as the author of the statement, which stat es that “‘[t]he U.S. \\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified the Trail Smelter operated by Teck Cominco (now called Teck) as the \\nprimary source of metals.’” Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 61  hazardous substances in the sample (or comparable samples) that meet the criteria for \\nactual contamination of the fishery.  \\n \\nHRS Section 4.1.3.3.2.2, Level II concentrations, provides instructions for the evaluation a fishery subject to \\nLevel II concentrations. It states:  \\n \\nDetermine those fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to Level \\nII concentrations. Do not include any fisheries (or portions of fisheries) already counted under the \\nLevel I concentrations factor.  \\n \\nAssign each fishery (or portion of a fishery) a value for human food chain population from table \\n4–18, based on the estimated human food production for the fishery. Estimate the human food \\nchain production for the fishery as specified in section 4.1.3.3.2.1.  \\n In describing the targets eligible for scoring in the human food chain threat , page 84 of the HRS documentation \\nrecord at proposal indicate d: \\n \\n4.1.3.3 Human Food Chain Threat - Targets  \\n The zone of actual contamination is the area of the UCR between the most upstream PPE (PPE1) \\nand farthest downstream observed release sample (EV001 -SED -1-092619). As stated previously, \\ncontamination and targets are not scored for the portion of the UCR loc ated in Canada (i.e., \\nbetween PPE1 and the U.S. -Canada border). Scored contamination and targets are evaluated for \\nthe U.S. portion of the zone of contamination, which encompasses a length of approximately 35 \\nmiles [ Figure 3 of this HRS documentation recor d].  \\n \\nThere is an observed release of metals contaminants to the UCR [see Section 4.1.2.1.1 of this \\nHRS documentation record], which is used for consumption fishing. Species caught for \\nconsumption in the UCR from the U.S.–Canada border to Marcus Washington (and within the \\nscored zone of actual contamination) include walleye, sturgeon, rainbow trout, kokanee, and \\nnorthern pike [Refs. 24, p. 1; 56, p. 1]. The original north boundary of the Colville Indian \\nReservation was the Canadian border; this former “North Half ” of the Colville Indian Reservation \\ncontinues to be an important homeland to the CCT. The CCT exercises certain management and \\nregulatory authority in this area from the northern boundary of the current reservation north to the \\nCanadian border, bounded by the Okanogan and Columbia rivers. CCT -owned land and \\nindividual tribal members reside on the North Half and use the lands, waters, and natural \\nresources for cultural and subsistence uses as they do on the reservation [Refs. 17, p. 61; 20, pp. \\n1-2; 21, pp. 1-2, 4].  \\n The Washington State Department of Health (WSDH) has a fish advisory in place for the \\nconsumption of various fish due to mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concerns. The \\nadvisory covers the portion of the UCR from the U.S.- Canada border to the Grand Coulee Dam. \\nGuidelines are in place for the consumption of species within the UCR including kokanee, lake \\nwhitefish, rainbow trout, white sturgeon, northern pike, burbot, longnose sucker, mountain \\nwhitefish, smallmouth bass, walleye, largescale sucker, a nd largemouth bass. A do- not-eat \\nadvisory is in place for northern pikeminnow [Ref. 23, p. 1]. A WSDH fish consumption advisory \\nTechnical Summary (dated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a primary source of metals \\nand other chemical contaminants in the UCR [Ref. 52, p. 1].  \\n \\nPage 86 of the HRS documentation record at proposal  present ed the scoring of actual contamination associated \\nwith targets in the human food chain threat  and stated: \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 62  4.1.3.3.2.2 Level II Concentrations  \\n \\nThe zone of actual contamination is the area of the UCR between the most upstream PPE (PPE1) \\nand farthest downstream observed release sample (EV001- SED -1-092619)…. The scored zone of \\nactual contamination in the UCR is used for consumption fishing [Refs. 24, p. 1; 56, p. 1]. \\nSpecies caught for consumption in the scored zone of actual contamination include walleye, \\nsturgeon, rainbow trout, kokanee and northern pike [Refs. 24, p. 1, 56. p. 1].  \\n \\nThe food chain production for the fishery is not documented, so based on the aforementioned information, the fishery is assigned to the category “Greater than 0 to 100 pounds per year,” \\nwhich corresponds to the assigned human food chain population value of 0.03 in Table 4-18 of \\nthe HRS [Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.3.2.2]. The available documentation demonstrates that fishing for human consumption occurs within the scored zone of actual contamination delineated by metals \\ndetected in sediment samples at concentrati ons meeting observed release criteria (i.e., \\nsignificantly above background and attributable to the site); therefore, the target fishery is evaluated for Level II actual contamination [ Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 1, \\nSection 4.1.3.3; 24, p. 1]. \\n \\nPage 86 of the HRS documentation record at proposal cited References 24 and 56. Reference 24 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, a phone conversation record with a manager for a fishing tour company, states:  \\n \\nMr. Lawson stated that although the guided tours target rainbow trout, which are caught and released, he knows that the portion of the Upper Columbia River from the U.S- Canada border to \\nMarcus, Washington is fished for consumption. Species caught for consu mption include walleye, \\nsturgeon, rainbow trout and northern pike. \\n \\nReference 56 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, a phone conversation record with a retired professor \\nof biology from Eastern Washington University, states:  \\n \\nProfessor Scholz also informed me that this portion of the UCR (between the U.S.-Canada border and Marcus, WA) is fished for consumption. Species caught for consumption include walleye, red \\nband trout (a type of rainbow trout), kokanee, white sturgeon, and northern pike. He also \\ninformed me that Colville Tribes still fish the UCR for subsistence, including the North Half, \\nwhich fished the upper portion of the UCR between the U.S.-Canada border border [ sic] and \\nMarcus, WA.\\n \\n \\nThus, the HRS documentation record at proposal provided sufficient documentation to support that a human food chain fishery is present at the Site to score a fishery as a target for HRS scoring purposes. Consistent with the \\nHRS instructions regarding identifying a fishery subject to actual human food chain contamination, the HRS \\ndocumentation record at proposal documented that fish are caught and consumed from within the zone of actual \\ncontamination t o establish that a Level II fishery.  \\n \\nRegarding Reference 52 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, while this reference was used to help \\nprovide context regarding the presence of a fishery as indicated on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at \\nproposal, this reference was not relied on to document a fishery within the zone of contamination at the Site. As \\nnoted above, two records of conversation (one each in References 24 and 56 ) were used to document the presence \\nof a human food chain fishery within the zone of contamination. See section 3.18, Non -Scoring HRS \\nDocumentation Record Comments, of this support document for clarifications related to Reference 52 and associated HRS documentation record text.  \\n \\nThis comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 \\n \\n 63  3.22 Soil Exposure Component  \\nComment: TAI and Stevens County commented that it is unclear whether scoring the upland soil contamination \\nwould achieve an NPL eligible score. TAI asserted that it is also unlikely that the soil contamination would \\nachieve a sufficient HRS site score as properties above the Action Level have been remediated and the area is \\nrural.  \\n \\nTAI and Stevens County provided comments questioning whether the areas with contaminated soil were \\nappropriately evaluated and considered residential. TAI asserted that the extent of the residential soil \\ncontamination described in general EPA communications is overstated because non -residential land use areas are \\nincluded. Stevens County commented that areas categorized as residential for scoring also include forest, industrial, and commercial areas. It stated that EPA representatives have alluded to the ar ea as residential even \\nthough many of the sampling areas are zoned as forest. It commented that it could identify where residential \\ndevelopment may occur. It asserted that the other non- residential areas that have been sampled are not eligible as \\nresidenti al areas for scoring or eligible under the soil lead guidance. Stevens County concluded that the resulting \\nscoring of these non- residential areas is incorrect.  \\n TAI asserted that the soil contamination, as opposed to the entire Upper Columbia River site, appears to be the \\npossible justification for placing the Site on the NPL. TAI acknowledged that the soil contamination may involve properties below future cleanup levels, but also stated that the presence “of some areas with lead concentrations \\nabove EPA’s new screening levels is not an appropriate basis for Listing a particular site.”  \\n \\nResponse: Insomuch as the commenter’s assertions are related to the evaluation of the soil exposure component, \\nthe soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway was properly scored in \\naccordance with the HRS in delineating an AOC. Further, when an HRS score is calculated, each individual \\npathway does not need to achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score, as the HRS site score is based on a \\ncombination of the individual pathway scores. In this case, the HRS evaluation of the Site included the surface \\nwater migration pathway in addition to the soil exposure component in scoring, and the Site achieved an NPL \\neligible HRS site score of 51.15 , which is above the minimum threshold for NPL placement. \\n \\nThe commenters’ specific points regarding scoring the soil exposure component, property types, and soil sample \\nconcentrations do not affect or invalidate the HRS site score:  \\n \\n• On the subject of what properties are eligible for consideration in the delineating the AOC, the AOC is \\ndelineated based on samples meeting observed contamination criteria. T he HRS does not  restrict observed \\ncontamination to a specific property type.  \\n• On the subject of the pathway- specific score achieved by the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, \\nthe HRS does not require that an individual pathway independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score.  \\n• On the subject of the presence of properties with soil contamination below an action level, residents may be eligible for scoring in the soil exposure component even if located at properties with soil sample \\nconcentrations below an action level.  \\n \\nIn presenting the instructions for determining eligible soil contamination, HRS Section 5.1.0, General considerations , states:  \\n \\n• Establish areas of observed contamination based on sampling locations at which there is  \\nobserved contamination as follows.  \\n- For all sources except contaminated soil, if observed contamination from the site is \\npresent at any sampling location within the source, consider that entire source to be an \\narea of  observed contamination.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  \\n \\n 64  - For contaminated soil, consider both the sampling location(s) with observed \\ncontamination from the  site and the area lying between such locations to be an area of \\nobserved contamination, unless  available information indicates otherwise.  \\n• If an area of observed contamination (or portion of such an area) is covered by a permanent, \\nor otherwise maintained, essentially impenetrable material (for example, asphalt) that is not \\nmore  than 2 feet thick, exclude that area (or portion of the area) in evaluating the soil \\nexposure  component.  \\n• For an area of observed contamination, consider only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria  for observed contamination for that area to be associated with that area in \\nevaluating the soil exposure  component (see section 2.2.2).  \\n Further instructions for assessing the resident population threat are presented in HRS Section 5.1.1, Resident \\npopulation threat . This section states:  \\n \\nEvaluate the resident population threat only if there is an area of observed contamination in one or more of the following locations:  \\n• Within the property boundary of a residence, school, or day care center and within \\n200 feet of the respective residence, school, or day care center, or  \\n• Within a workplace property boundary and within 200 feet of a workplace area, or  \\n• Within the boundaries of a resource specified in section 5.1.1.3.4, or  \\n• Within the boundaries of a terrestrial sensitive environment specified in section 5. 1.1.3.5 \\n[emphasis added]  \\n \\nFor assessing the targets factor category, HRS Section 5.1.1.3, Targets , instructs a scorer, in part, to:  \\n \\nEvaluate the targets factor category for the resident population threat based on five factors: \\nresident individual, resident population, workers, resources, and terrestrial sensitive \\nenvironments.  \\nIn evaluating the targets factor category for the resident population threat, count only the following as targets:  \\n• Resident individual – a person living or attending school or day care on a property with \\nan area of observed contamination and whose residence, school, or day care center, \\nrespectively,  is on or within 200 feet of the areas of observed contamination.  \\n• Worker – a person working on a property with an area of observed contamination and \\nwhose  workplace area is on or within 200 feet of the area of observed contamination.…  \\n \\nIn describing the scoring of the AOC, page 92 of the HRS documentation record at proposal state d:  \\n \\nAOC A is defined by a polygon bounded by soil contamination meeting HRS observed contamination criteria (i.e., locations showing lead and arsenic at concentrations significantly \\nabove published background levels and collected from the top 2 feet of soil) … However, since \\nEPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area dating back to 2003 [see Site Summary section of this HRS documentation record], not all properties were \\nincluded within the AOC polygon; for the purpose of deter mining the hazardous waste quantity \\narea and resident population for the AOC, a conservative approach was taken and only \\ncontaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did not have soil removals, were \\nincluded in the calculation ….

The AOC was determined \\nbased on soil samples meeting observed contamination criteria for lead and/or arsenic as specified in HRS Section \\n5.1.0. The commenter has not challenged the evaluation of whether particular samples used to delineate the AOC \\nmet observed contamination criteria. In accordance with the instructions in HRS Sections 5.1.0, 5.1.1, and 5.1.1.3, \\nand as presented on pages 92, 100, 102, 103, 107, and 108 of the HRS documentation record at proposa l, quoted \\nabove, eligible residents were determined based on either inferred contamination on residences being located \\nwithin the AOC or samples meeting observed contamination criteria that were collected on the property and \\nwithin 200 feet of a residence. Thus, the HRS documentation record at proposal identified eligible residents \\nduring the evaluation of the population associated with eligible residences consistent with the HRS requirements.  \\n \\nThe HRS does not require that an individual pathway independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score. The \\nHRS site score, which takes into account the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway score, is greater than the NPL placement threshold of 28.50 making this Site eligible for placement on the NPL. The soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathw ay score of 21.66 does not independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score; \\nhowever, per HRS Section 2.1.1, Calculation of HRS site score , an HRS site score is calculated using the pathway \\nscores from all four pathways for the Site. At this Site, the surface water migration pathway was also evaluated \\nand received a pathway score of 100.00. Following the HRS methodology and accounting for the scores from the \\ntwo pathways scored, the resulting HRS site score is 51.15 making the Site eligible for NPL placement. The rationale for placing the Site on the NPL is in part due to the Site achieving an NPL eligible HRS site score based \\non the evaluation of both the surface water migration and the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway s \\nconsistent with the HRS requirements for scoring a site.   \\nRegarding the consideration of the  action level in determining eligible samples and residents, as explained above \\nin section 3.16, Regulatory Limits and Screening Levels, of this support document, contamination below an action \\nlevel or other screening level may still be eligible for consideration in documenting observed contamination. The \\nHRS uses the criteria for observed contamination as specified in HRS Section 5.1.0, quoted above, to evaluate the soil exposure component. As explained above, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly determined \\nwhich soil samples met observed contamination criteria, which is not challenged by the commenter. Residences and associated residents were also correctly calculated as explained above.  \\n This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. \\n \\n4. Conclusion \\nThe original HRS score for this site was 5 1.15. Based on the above responses to public comments, the score \\nremains unchanged. The final scores for the Upper Columbia River site are:  \\n \\nGround Water:      Not S cored  \\nSurface Water:       100.00 \\nSoil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion:   21.66 \\nAir Pathway:       Not S cored  \\nHRS Score:       51.15 \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAttachment A  \\nLetter from Jarred Michael Erickson, Chairman, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville \\nReservation to Casey Sixkiller, EPA Region 10 Administrator. December 6, 2023  \\n \\n \\n \\n The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation \\nPost Office Box 150 -21 Colville St. \\nNespelem, WA 99155 Phone: 509-634-2381 Fax: 509-634-2387 \\n12/6/2023 \\nCasey Sixkiller \\nRegion 10 Administrator \\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency \\nSeattle, WA 98101 \\nEspiritu.Vicki@epa.gov \\nRe: concurrence on Superfund listing of the Upper Columbia River Site \\nDear Administrator Sixkiller: \\nI received your letter dated November 30, 2023 in regard to the proposed addition of the Upper Columbia \\nRiver (\"UCR\") Site to the Superfund National Priorities List (\"NPL\"). The Colville Tribes supports placement \\nof the UCR Site on the NPL. \\nThe UCR Site includes areas within the traditional homeland, and current Reservation, of the Colville \\nTribes. Historical disposal and discharges of wastes and emissions from smelter operations have \\ncontaminated the UCR Site and pose a risk to human health as well as to the sovereignty and economic \\nsecurity of the Colville Tribes. \\nAs you correctly note in your letter, the Colville Tribes has worked for at least two decades to address the \\nlegacy of contamination at the UCR Site, including litigation with our partners in the federal government, the \\nState of Washington, and the Spokane Tribe of Indians. An NPL listing will allow access to resources that \\nare much needed for remediation of the UCR Site. \\nThe Colville Tribes appreciates and accepts your offer to coordinate with our staff as the NPL listing \\nprocess proceeds. Thank you for this effort to bring maximum resources to this remediation as quickly as \\npossible. \\nchael Erickson \\nChairman \\nConfederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation '"
