iii Executive Summary  
Section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the EPA prepare a list of national 
priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants 
throughout the United States. An original National Priorities List (NPL) was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). CERCLA requires that EPA update the list at least annually.

his document provides responses to public comments received on the Upper Columbia River site, proposed on 
March 7, 2024 (89 FR 16498). This site is being added to the NPL based on an evaluation under EPA’s Hazard Ranking System (HRS) in a final rule published in the Federal Register in December 2024. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 iv  Introduction 
This document explains the rationale for adding the Upper Columbia River site in Upper Columbia River, 
Washington to the National Priorities List (NPL) of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites and provides responses to 
public comments received on this site li sting proposal. The EPA proposed this site to the NPL on March 7, 2024 
(89 FR 16498). This site is being added to the NPL based on an evaluation under the Hazard Ranking System 
(HRS) in a final rule published in the Federal Register in December 2024. 
 
Background of the NPL 
In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. Sections 9601 et seq . in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. 
CERCLA was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), 
Public Law No. 99-499, stat., 1613 et seq. To implement CERCLA, EPA promulgated the revised National Oil 
and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA Section 105 and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP, further 
revised by EPA on September 16, 1985 (50 FR 37624) and November 20, 1985 (50 FR 47912), sets forth 
guidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. On March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666), EPA further revised the NCP in 
response to SARA.  
 Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the NCP include:  
 
criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United 
States for the purpose of taking remedial action and, to the extent practicable, taking into account 
the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action. 
 Removal action involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response to emergency conditions or on a 
short-term or temporary basis (CERCLA Section 101). Remedial action is generally long- term in nature and 
involves response actions that are consiste nt with a permanent remedy for a release (CERCLA Section 101). 
Criteria for placing sites on the NPL, which makes them eligible for remedial actions financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA, were included in the HRS. EPA promulgated the HRS as Appendix A of the NCP 
(47 FR 31219, July 16, 1982). On December 14, 1990 (56 FR 51532), EPA promulgated revisions to the HRS in 
response to SARA, and established the effective date for the HRS revisions as March 15, 1991. On January 9, 
2017, EPA promulgated a further revision to the HRS that added a component for evaluating the threats posed by the intrusion of subsurface contamination into regularly occupied structures. These changes are consistent with, 
and comply with, the statutory requirements of SARA.  
 
Section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended, requires that the statutory criteria provided by the HRS be used to 
prepare a list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throu ghout the United States. The list, which is Appendix B of the NCP, is the NPL. 
 An original NPL of 406 sites was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). At that time, an HRS score 
of 28.5 was established as the cutoff for listing because it yielded an initial NPL of at least 400 sites, as suggested 
by CERCLA. The NPL has been expanded several times since then, most recently on September 5, 2024 (89 FR 72331). The Agency also has published a number of proposed rulemakings to add sites to the NPL. The most 
recent proposal was on September 5, 2024 (89 FR 72356). 
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 v  Development of the NPL 
The primary purpose of the NPL is stated in the legislative history of CERCLA (Report of the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works, Senate Report No. 96-848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 [1980]).  
The priority list serves primarily informational purposes, identifying for the States and the public those facilities and sites or other releases which appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a 
facility or site on the list does not in itself refle ct a judgment of the activities of its owner or 
operator, it does not require those persons to undertake any action, nor does it assign liability to 
any person. Subsequent government actions will be necessary in order to do so, and these actions 
will be attended by all appropriate procedural safeguards. 
 The NPL, therefore, is primarily an informational and management tool. The identification of a site for the NPL is 
intended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of the human health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA -
financed remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of sites EPA believes warrant further investigation. Finally, listing a site may , to the extent potentially responsible parties are 
identifiable at the time of listing, serve as notice to such parties that the Agency may initiate CERCLA -financed 
remedial action.  
 CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites among the known releases or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, and Section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certain 
enumerated and other appropriate factors in doing so. Thus, as a matter of policy, EPA has the discretion not to 
use CERCLA to respond to certain types of releases. Where other authorities exist, placing sites on the NPL for 
possible remedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Ther efore, EPA has chosen not to place certain 
types of sites on the NPL even though CERCLA does not exclude such action. If, however, the Agency later 
determines that sites not listed as a matter of policy are not being properly responded to, the Agency may consider 
placing them on the NPL. 
 
Hazard Ranking System 
The HRS is the principal mechanism EPA uses to place uncontrolled waste sites on the NPL. It is a numerically 
based screening system that uses information from initial, limited investigations -- the preliminary assessment and 
site inspection -- to assess t he relative potential of sites to pose a threat to human health or the environment. HRS 
scores, however, do not determine the sequence in which EPA funds remedial response actions, because the information collected to develop HRS scores is not sufficient i n itself to determine either the extent of 
contamination or the appropriate response for a particular site. Moreover, the sites with the highest scores do not necessarily come to the Agency's attention first, so that addressing sites strictly on the basis of ranking would in 
some cases require stopping work at sites where it was already underway. Thus, EPA relies on further, more detailed studies in the remedial investigation/feasibility study that typically follows listing.  
 The HRS uses a structured value analysis approach to scoring sites. This approach assigns numerical values to 
factors that relate to or indicate risk, based on conditions at the site. The factors are grouped into three categories. 
Each category has a maxim um value. The categories are:  
 
• likelihood that a site has released or has the potential to release hazardous substances into the 
environment; Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
vi •characteristics of the waste (e.g., toxicity and waste quantity); and
•targets (e.g., people or sensitive environments) affected by the release.
Unde
r the HRS, four pathways can be scored for one or more components and threats as identified below: 
•Gr
ound Water Migration (S gw)
— population
•Su
rface Water Migration (S sw)
The following threats are evaluated for two separate migration components, overland/flood migration and
ground water to surface water.
— drinking water
— human food chain
— sensitive environments
•Soi
l Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion (S sessi)
— Soil Exposure Component:
o resident population
o nearby population
— Subsurface Intrusion Component
opopulation
•Ai
r Migration (S a)
— population
Af
ter scores are calculated for one or more pathways according to prescribed guidelines, they are combined using 
the following root -mean -square equation to determine the overall site score (S), which ranges from 0 to 100 : 
If all pathway scores are low, the HRS score is low. However, the HRS score can be relatively high even if only 
one pathway score is high. This is an important requirement for HRS scoring because some extremely 
dangerous sites pose threats through only one pathway. For example, buried leaking drums of hazardous 
substances can c ontaminate drinking water wells, but - - if the drums are buried deep enough and the substances 
not very volatile -- not surface water or air. 
Other Mechanisms for Listing 
There are two mechanisms other than the HRS by which sites can be p laced  on the NPL. The first of these 
mechanisms, authorized by the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), allows each State and Territory to designate one 
site as its high est priority regardless of score. The last mechanism,  authorized by the NCP at 40  CFR 
300.425(c)(3), allows listing a site if it meets the following three requirements: 
•Ag
ency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued
a health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release;
•EPA determines the site poses a significant threat to public health; andUpper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 vii  • EPA anticipates it will be more cost- effective to use its remedial authority than to use its emergency removal 
authority to respond to the site.

2. Site Description 
The Upper Columbia River site (the Site) includes the release of metals from two smelters (Cominco1 and Le Roi 
smelters) to the Upper Columbia River and to soil . Associated contamination in the area is the combined result of 
historical discharges of wastes and emissions from the two smelter operations, some of which has comingled in 
soils and surface water sediments. Upland soils in the area are contaminated with  metals, including arsenic and 
lead. Sediments in the Upper Columbia River contain slag, a by- product of smelting, and are contaminated with

 5  metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc. There is a significant 
quantity of slag present in the river system. The Site is being placed on the NPL based on an HRS evaluation of 
the Site documenting that contamination in sediments and soil achieve an NPL-eligible HRS site score. Although 
the contamination has comingled, the HRS documentation record at proposal also showed that releases associated with the Cominco smelter (approximately 10 miles upstream of the i nternational border) and releases associated 
with the Le Roi smelter (approximately 10 river miles downstream of the international border) each would independently achieve an NPL qualifying HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately. 
 
The HRS evaluation of the Site scored the surface water migration pathway based on concentrations of hazardous substances in sediment s from the Upper Columbia River and the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway 
based on the concentrations of hazardous substances in soil . As presented in the HRS documentation record at 
proposal, the Site, for HRS scoring purposes, includes contaminated sediments in the Upper Columbia River 
between and downstream of the three scored HRS sources spanning approximately 35 river miles of the Columbia 
River  from the U.S.-Canada border south and west to Marcus, Washington (see Figure 1 of this support document 
below). The Site includes three scored sources: slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter, 
which is currently owned by Teck Metals Ltd.  and located upstream of the international border in Canada (Source 
1); contaminated soil on the  former Le Roi smelter facility in Northport, Washington (Source 2); and sluice box 
discharge associated with the former Le Roi smelter (Source 3). These sources have been documented to contain metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver, zinc, and mercury. The 
releases from the smelters have become comingled in the Upper Columbia River (at and downstream of the Le 
Roi smelter) . In addition, an area of observed contamination (AOC) in soil in Northport, Washington was 
documented in the HRS documentation record at proposal. R eleases from both facilities have also  become 
comingled in the AOC soil contamination.  
In the evaluation of the surface water migration pathway, contamination and targets were scored in the HRS 
documentation record at proposal for the U.S. portion of the zone of contamination, which encompasses a length of approximately 35 river miles. Both an observed release by direct observation and an observed release by 
chemical analysis were documented. Observed releases by direct observation were scored based on Cominco smelter discharge of hazardous substance-bearing slag/effluent to the river and Le Roi smelter discharge of 
hazardous substance -bearing slag to the river. An observed release by chemical analysis based on the 
concentrations of metals (i.e., antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc) in sediment s was established in the HRS documentation record at proposal. Targets in the surface water migration 
pathway (i.e., fishery, wetlands, and a federal- designated threatened species habitat) were evaluated as subject to 
Level II concentrations. 
 
In the evaluation of the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, t he AOC 
is located in a residential area to the southwest of the former Le Roi smelter and is defined by a polygon bounded 
by soil contamination meeting HRS observed contamination criteria (i.e., locations showing lead and arsenic at 
concentrations significantly above published background levels and collected from the top 2 feet of soil). This 
AOC is attributable to historical aerial deposition from both smelters. Historical smelter smokestack emissions 
from both smelters have resulted in upland residential soil contamination; residential populations subject to Level 
I and Level II contamination for HRS scoring purposes  associated with the AOC were documented in the HRS 
documentation record at proposal for the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion 
pathway.  
 
Since 2003, numerous EPA removal activities have occurred in and around the Northport, Washington area, inc
luding several removal site evaluations (RSEs). In 2003 and 2004, Northport residential and commercial 
properties with lead concentrations in soil greater than the removal action level  of 1,000 milligrams per kilogram 
(mg/kg ) were identified for a time-critical removal action (TCRA). In 2004, a removal action was conducted at 
the former Le Roi smelter and residential areas with the excavated contaminat ed soils being consolidated at an 11-
acre area of the Le Roi smelter site. In 2014 and 2016, residential properties and tribal allotments were sampled. 
For these sampling events, a removal action level of 700 mg/kg for lead in soil was evaluated.  In an EPA dispute Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 6  decision issued in 2015, EPA stated an intent to select a lower removal action level for lead in soil, lowering the 
action level from 1,000 mg/kg to 700 mg/kg. Based on analytical results from residential soil sampling, TCRAs 
were conducted in 2015, 2017, and 2018 using a removal action level of 700 mg/kg. The EPA conducted 
additional RSE s at properties within the town of Northport that were sampled in 2003 and 2004 as described 
above and found to have lead in soil at concentrations near or above 700 mg/kg. In 2020, soil cleanup activities 
were conducted  using a removal action level of 700 mg/kg. The EPA conducted a subsequent RSE in the 
residential area of Northport in 2021. TCRAs were conducted at additional properties in 2022 using a removal action level for lead in soil of 700 mg/kg. In 2024, additional TCRAs were conducted using a removal action level 
of 200 mg/kg.  
 
Addi
tional investigations have been ongoing at the Site, including a remedial investigation and feasibility study 
(RI/FS). The RI/FS is underway as part of the 2006 Settlement Agreement between Teck Cominco Metals Ltd., Teck Cominco American Incorporated (TAI), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and the EPA; there is no
 
settlement agreement for funding or performance of a potential remedial action . In February 2021, the EPA 
released a Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) for the Upper Columbia River site, which was conducted as 
part of the ongoing RI/FS. An Upland Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment and an Aquatic Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment are also underway. The ongoing RI/FS will guide subsequent stages of the CERCLA process, 
and information from completed, ongoing, and subsequent investigations will inform the ultimate extent of s ite-
related contamination. Completed site investigations and remedial work, as well as time critical removal actions,  
were considered  in the HRS evaluation of the Site, and the current conditions in sediments and soil at the Site 
achieve an HRS site score, describ ed above, that is eligible for placement on the NPL as presented in the HRS 
documentation record at proposal.

 8  3. Summary of Comments  
The state of Washington, the Spokane Tribe of Indians , the Confederated Tribes of the Co lville Reservation2 the 
Lands Council, the Upper Columbia United Tribes , the Spokane Mountaineers, and 20 citizens supported or did 
not oppose placing the Site on the NPL.  
 
Teck American Incorporated3 (TAI) , the Stevens County Board of County Commissioners4 (hereinafter referred 
to as Stevens County), the Eastern Washington Council of Governments (EWCOG), the Lincoln County 
Commissioners (Lincoln County), South Columbia Basin Irrigation District (SCBID), East Columbia Basin Irrigation District (ECBID) , Quincy- Columbia Basin Irrigation District (QCBID) , Board of Commissioners, 
County of Benton ( Benton County ), the Rimrock Cabin Owners Association, and 47 citizens opposed placing the 
Site on the NPL. TAI also requested that the EPA consider its comments prior to adding the Site on the NPL.  
 TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens provided comments on the supporting data and documentation. TAI 
and Stevens County questioned the data included in the HRS documentation record at proposal, asserting that 
additional data and information were available as a part of the ongoing RI/FS. TAI stated that “arbitrarily limited 
data and completed studies” were used. TAI commented that evaluating the Site with the HRS is inappropriate 
given the level of investigation into the Site already completed.  
 
In discussing the Site as presented at proposal, TAI and Stevens County commented  on perceived difference s 
between the site as described in previous EPA communication and the Site as scored. TAI and Stevens County asserted that past descriptions of the Site pointed to uplands residential soil contamination , while the HRS 
documentation record at proposal primarily focuses on the sediment contamination in the Upper Columbia River.   
TAI questioned the inclusion of the Northport area as part of the Site asserting  that the Northport area has 
historically been treated as a separate site from the Upper Columbia River. TAI disagreed with comingling of the 
smelters’ contamination in soil as the basis for inclusion of the Northport area as part of the site, asserting that 
Cominco smelter aerial emissions are limited to the smelter in British Columbia and a few miles into Washington .  
 Several commenters submitted comments discussing possible effects of the NPL designation. TAI, Stevens County, and multiple citizens expressed concern for how liability will be assigned for the contamination and/or 
what the sources of funding for remediati on of the contamination will be. Stevens County, Lincoln County, 
SCBID, QCBID , ECBID  and 20 citizens provided comments discussing the possible impacts to the region, 
including negative economic impacts, as a result of a NPL designation.  
 Several commenters opposed to listing provided comments discussing issues related to the listing process. 
Comments related to the listing process include:  
 
• Comments questioning the rationale for listing given that the Site is undergoing an RI/FS.  
• Comments asserting that the HRS is intended for a limited evaluation of a Site in the preliminary stages of the evaluation process.  
• Assertions that there is no need for listing based on the conditions at the Site.  
 
2 See the December 6, 2023 , letter from the Confederated Tribes of the Col ville Reservation  to EPA, included as Attachment 
A of this support document . 
3 Teck American Incorporated  submitted comments on the proposed listing and is an affiliate of Teck Metals Ltd. , the owner 
and operator of the Trail smelter  (also referred to as the Cominco Smelter and the Teck Cominco Smelter)  in Canada .  
4 The Stevens County Board of County Commissioners submitted comments on its behalf along with comments on behalf of 
the Eastern Washington Council of Governments. (See Docket ID EPA -HQ-OLEM -2024- 0068 -0080 on regulations.gov  fo r 
the combined comment submission by Stevens County and the Eastern Washington Council of Governments.) Comments 
specifically authored by the Eastern Washington Council of Governments were included as Attachment E of the combined comment submission.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 9  • Assertions that information about the Site has been delayed or withheld.  
• Requests that listing not occur until after the completion of the RI/FS for the Site.  
• Comments that ecological benefits are overdue and ineffective.  
 
Additionally, in Attachments A5 and D6 to its comment submission, in opposition of NPL listing and 
disagreement with the state concurrence with listing,  Stevens County stated that they “do not relinquish” their 
“authority as elected officials over to the governor.”  
 
Multiple commenters discussed whether the risk posed by the Site is sufficient for NPL placement, commenting  
that: 
 
• The Site does not pose a risk to human health.  
• Fish from the Upper Columbia River are generally not impacted .  
• Soil contamination at residential properties is being or has been addressed via removal actions or remedial 
activities .  
• The quality of water in the Columbia River is clean and/or meets water quality standards.  
• The area is clean except for rubbish.  
 In questioning technical aspects of the HRS scoring of the Site, TAI commented that slag is not a hazardous 
substance under CERCLA , and that the solid waste definition in 40 CFR 261.4 excludes slag. TAI asserted that 
since slag is not a hazardous substance under CER CLA, using slag to determine the hazardous waste quantity for 
Source 1 is incorrect and misleading.  
 In challenging the evaluation of the surface water migration pathway, commenters asserted that : 
 
• The slag in the river is unlikely to release metals.   
• Contamination is buried in sediment at deeper depths , and it would be safer to leave it as-is than risking 
rereleasing the associated metals by stirring sediments during removal processes .  
• The other possible sources not scored section of the HRS documentation record at proposal is incomplete  
because it does not discuss other possible origins of contamination .  
• The waste characteristics factor category value was inappropriately calculated and overestimated . 
• Fish from the Columbia River are generally safe for consumption.  
• The Site may not be the driver of fish advisories in place for sensitive groups .  
 In commenting on the evaluation of the soil exposure component, commenters asserted  that: 
 
• The soil exposure component would no t achieve an NPL -eligible score by itself .  
• The extent of residential contamination described in general EPA communications is an overstatement of 
the residential land use area.  
• Areas identified as residential for scoring purposes or future cleanup purposes inappropriately included 
forest, industrial, and commercial areas.  
• Only limited soil contamination remains because properties above the action level have been remediated.  
 
In this support document, the EPA responds to comments submitted on the March 2024 proposed listing of the 
Upper Columbia River  site. After consideration of these items, the HRS site score remains unchanged , and the 
EPA is appropriately placing the site on the NPL.

10 3.1 Support for Listing and Other Non-opposition Comments 
The state of Washington, the Spokane Tribe of Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the Co lville Reserv ation,7 the 
Lands Council, the Upper Columbia United Tribes, the Spokane Mountaineers and 20 citizens expressed support 
for the proposed listing of the Site on the NPL.  
T
he state of the Washington expressed willingness to participate with cleanup activities  at the Site. Reasons for 
support provided by the state of Washington include: 
•Addr
essing historical contamination that may be posing risks to human health and the environment ,
p
articularly to low -income and Tribal resident s
•O
btain ing funding for a comprehensive cleanu p
•Allo
wing for additional and timely cleanup and investigation as the current RI/FS work is bei ng
co
mpleted under a settlement agreement
•Allowing for cleanup which is outside of the scope of the RI/FS settlement agreement
•Allowing for authority over the Site investigation and cleanup in accordance with CERCLA
•Enabling cost recover y
The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation  provided support for the EPA’s proposal to add the Site on 
the NPL, noting t hey will coordinate with EPA staff as the NPL listing process moves forward. T hey commented  
that NPL listing will bring access to resources needed for cleanup of the Site.  
The Spokane Tribe of Indians expresse d support for NPL lis ting, referring  to the negative impacts associated w ith 
Site-related c ontamination , such as health and  welfare impacts, economi c security,  and political integrity of the 
Spokane Tribe of Indians. The Spokane Tribe of Indians asserted that delays have occurred as a resu lt of the Site 
not being placed on the NPL and the RI/FS process is still ongoing. O ther reason s for support cited by the 
Spokane Tribe of Indians include the ability of the EPA to use federal funding, control of cleanup , cost recovery, 
the ability o f the EPA to  better c haracterize the  contamination.   
The Spokane Tribe of Indians concurred wit h the propose d listing of the Site on the NPL assumi ng that the Site is 
“meant to encompass the Upper Columbia River from the U.S. Canadia n border and downstream , including Lake 
Roosevelt, to the Grand Coulee Dam.” The Spokane Tribe of Indians commente d that the HRS documentation 
record at proposal provided an incomplete characterizati on of the contamination i n that it focuse d on the area 
from the border to Marcus , Washington, and requeste d that future remedial inve stigations and  response activities 
characteri ze the  lower r iver.  
The Upper Columbia United Tribes supported the proposal to add the Site to the NPL, stating that NPL placement 
would allow for fundi ng, legal status , and resources t o address contamination affecting the land, water, and 
wildlife. T he U pper C olumbia U nited Tribes asserted t hat site-related co ntaminants, suc h as metals, may be 
posing a risk to human health a nd the environment. T hey stated that the “ federal government should dedicate 
more resources to address t he legacy of  heavy  metal p ollution  in the waters and lands of the uppe r Columbia 
Region.” They als o stated that the government should procee d “in recovering clea n and s afe environments in 
support of these recovery efforts and the communities who stand to benefit from them.” 
Multiple citizens and the Spokane Mountaineers support ed listing. O ne citizen provided support for listing i f 
access to the Upper Columbia River or Lake Roosevelt is not restricted. A citizen commented that CERCLA 
activities have fallen short in addressing sites in the past. One citizen also asserted that negative economic impacts 
7 See the December 6, 2023 , letter from the Confederated Tribes of the Col ville Reservation  to EPA, included as Attachment 
A of this support document . Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 11  may not necessarily occur and property values may not necessarily decrease. Additional reasons for support 
provided by commenters include: 
 
• Cleanup of s ite-related contamination  
• Protection of human health, wildlife, and/or the environment  
• Possible negotiations and funding for cleanup  
• Positive impacts to the economy as a result of remediation of contamination  
• The possible removal of buried waste at the former Le Roi smelter property.  
 
The Lands Council and a citizen expressed a request for cooperation with tribes in addressing the Site.  
 
Response : The EPA has added the Upper Columbia River site to the NPL. Listing makes a site eligible for 
remedial action funding under CERCLA, and the EPA will examine the site to determine what response, if any, is 
appropriate. Actual funding may not necessarily be undertaken in the precise order of HRS scores, however, and upon more detailed investigation may not be necessary at all in some cases. The EPA will determine the need for 
using Superfund monies for remedial activities on a site-by- site basis, considering the NPL ranking, State 
priorities, further site investigation, other response alternatives, and other factors as appropriate.  
 
Regarding the Site definition and extent of S ite, please see sections 3.4, Site Description and Definition , and 3.5, 
Extent of Site, of this support document.  
  Regarding a commenter’s concern about access to the Upper Columbia River, the EPA acknowledges the 
commenter ’s concern and notes that access to the river is not determined by the listing decision.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.2 Community Involvement 
Comment : TAI , Stevens County, and six citizens submitted comments about EPA communications to the public, 
the level of community involvement, and the EPA’s coordination with local government.  
 
TAI stated that the EPA made incorrect statements in public communications about benefits the EPA may gain 
through NPL designation. TAI asserted that the EPA’s news release about the proposed listing of the Upper 
Columbia River site on the NPL “incorrectly suggests that a site listing automatically ensures EPA can access 
Superfund dollars: ‘Listing the site on the NPL allows EPA to access Superfund dollars for cleanup activities 
which can also help ensure a more timely cleanup.’”8 TAI commented NPL listing makes sites eligible for federal 
funding, and it  does not guarantee that funding. TAI also pointed to a local newspaper article in which an EPA 
spokesman stated that NPL listing gives the EPA “access to  legal tools that could compel action if needed.”9 
However, TAI argued that NPL listing “does not, in itself, reflect the responsible parties or the bases of their 
liability, require those entities to take any action, determine whether remediation is possible or even necessary or 
the extent of any potential remediation, or assign liability to any person or entity.” TAI also argued that NPL 
listing does not give the EPA additional enforcement authority.  
 
Stevens County and multiple citizens discussed the level of community involvement and coordination with local 
government. Stevens County commented that while the EPA has indicated that it would like to work with the 
community and local officials to ensure contaminated areas that have been identified are within acceptable levels, 
 
8 TAI cited a March 5, 2024 EPA news release available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -
columbia -river -wa-superfund- list. TAI quoted the statement, “L isting the site on the NPL allows EPA to access Superfund 
dollars for cleanup activities which can also help ensure a more timely cleanup. ” 
9 TAI cited a March 5, 2024 article in The Spokesman -Review available at 
https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/mar/05/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -to-superf/ .  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 12  it has been not included in the process. Five  citizens commented that local officials’ input has been ignored, and 
three of these citizens argued that local officials would be communicating there is a problem if concerning levels 
of contamination were present in the Upper Columbia River area. Five ci tizens also stated that the urgency to list 
the Site on the NPL is politically motivated.  
 
Stevens County stated that “ local elected officials do not concur with EPA that NPL listing is needed or warranted 
at this time .” Stevens County asserted that it is “willing to help” and “EPA regional staff should be focused on 
working with the local governments.” Stevens County commented that it is willing to cooperate to find solutions 
for health, safety, and ecological concerns. Two citizens commented that government officials opposed the designation, and one of these citizens suggested that local officials should be consulted about the issue.  
 
Stevens County asserted that EPA provided insufficient information and communication. It commented that:  
 
• The EPA has delayed and withheld information .  
• A local group received a draft document— the draft Upland Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment 
(BERA) —from the EPA for comment while the local government was not given the same opportunity.  
• The messaging provided by the EPA suggested soil contamination is the issue at the Site although the 
scoring of the Site relied on other data.  
• Data used in the listing, including compounds and metals other than lead, were not provided to the local government.  
• The EPA has not been transparent in the process, and misleading information about the process has been provided.  
• The EPA provided different information in public meetings than in the proposal to add the Site to the NPL.  
• The Governor provided a concurrence letter to the EPA without obtaining input from the local government.  
• Local public health offices were not consulted.  
 One citizen requested that, before allowing federal government and EPA involvement, local residents should be 
allowed to participate and given a controlling vote. Two  citizen s asserted that local individuals would be more 
familiar with the area. A citizen also commented that the local community should be given opportunities for input and discussion along with local voting options for agreed-upon cleanup.  
 
Response : The EPA communicated with  the public frequently during the site assessment and RI/FS stage s and has 
made multiple efforts to involve the community and other interested parties throughout the RI/FS  and site 
assessment stages. The EPA will continue community engagement efforts for the Site throughout the CERCLA 
process.   
 Regarding the procedures used to list the Site on the NPL, the EPA complied with all relevant administrative 
requirements. The HRS evaluation of the Site is consistent with the HRS regulation and the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA). The HRS documentation record at proposal and this support document clearly document 
that the EPA has complied with the HRS regulation; this support document addresses all comments on the 
proposed listing of this Site, including those comments that challenge compliance with the HRS, and shows that 
HRS requirements have been met in every aspect of the evaluation of this Site.  
 
As part of the standard community involvement process, the Superfund program offers numerous opportunities 
for public participation at NPL sites. The EPA Regional Office develop s a Community Involvement Plan (CIP) 
before  remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS)  field work begins . The CIP is the “work plan” for Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 13  community relations activities that the EPA will conduct during the entire cleanup process. In developing a CIP, 
Regional staff interview s State and local officials and interested citizens to learn about citizen concerns, site 
conditions, and local history. This information is used to formulate a schedule of activities designed to keep citizens apprised and to keep the EPA aware of community concerns. Typical community relations activities 
include: 
 
• Public meetings where  the EPA presents a summary of technical information regarding the site and 
citizens can ask questions or comment  
• Small, informal public sessions where  EPA representatives are available to citizens 
• Development and distribution of fact sheets to keep citizens up to date on site activities 
 
For each site , an “information repository” is established, usually in a librar y or town hall  and/or on an EPA Web 
site, containing reports, studies, fact sheets, and other documents containing information about the site. The  EPA 
Regional Office continually updates the repository and must ensure that the facility housing the repository has copying capabilities. For the Upper Columbia River site, t he EPA Regional Office developed a CIP for the Site in 
2004 before the start of the RI/FS, and information repositories have been established in libraries in the local communities . 
 
In addition to meeting federal requirements, the  EPA ensure s that community involvement is a continuing activity 
designed to meet the specific needs of the community. Anyone wanting information should contact the Community Involvement Coordinator in the appropriate EPA Regional Office.  
 To provide information about the ongoing progress at the Upper Columbia River site , because a remedial 
investigation/feasibility study is ongoing, the EPA maintains an Upper Columbia River Study Area webpage 
(https://www.epa.gov/columbiariver/upper- columbia -river -study- area). This webpage provides the community 
and other interested parties information regarding the Site status, publicly available documents, including fact sheets, and other relevant site- specific information. The EPA hosted numerous outreach events in the community 
regarding the Site . These outreach activities have included public meetings and briefings with members of 
Congress and local officials. Table 1 below presents a selected list of outreach events the EPA conducted prior to proposal.

Region 10 dating back to 200 0 regarding the Upper Columbia River site.  
 
Additionally, as part of the EPA’s Technical Assistance Services for Communities  program , the EPA awarded 
Citizens for a Clean Columbia a technical assistance contract to fund participation and a review of the RI/FS 
process. The EPA provides further information regarding community technical assistance on its Upper Columbia 
River Study A rea webpage.  
 
Regarding coordination with the public and other interested parties or stakeholders, t he CERCLA process 
encourages public participation , including potentially responsible parties. The public can comment during the 
comment period (typically 60 days) after a site is proposed for listing on the NPL and during the time the EPA is 
evaluating and selecting a remedy. The EPA may also hold a publ ic hearing during the latter decision -making 
period. If private parties conduct remedial actions under a consent decree between the EPA and the parties, the decree is also subject to public comment. The EPA believes that the above process offers the public sufficient opportunity to present facts and opinions germane to its decision-making.   
 Regarding comments addressing the tools that become accessible to the EPA as a result of  listing a site, the EPA 
statements referred to by TAI and communicated to the public regarding funding and legal tools are correct. In 
public communications the EPA stated that NPL listing allow s the EPA “to access Superfund dollars for cleanup 
activities .” This statement did not assert that such funding is automatic at listing  or that remedial action is 
automatic. Listing a site on the NPL also gives the EPA “access to legal tools that could compel action if needed.” This statement by the EPA about access to legal tools does not imply that the NPL listing itself assigns liability or 
requires specific remedial actions.  With NPL listing, EPA may use federal funds to advance CERCLA response 
actions when negotiations with a potentially responsible party or parties (PRPs) are not successful or become protracted, or if a PRP is not in compliance with an enforcement order or settlement agreement . The EPA would 
then seek to recover its costs from the PRP (s). This approach incentivizes PRPs to negotiate or to comple te work  
becau se the cost for a private party to conduct work is generally less expensive than costs incurred by the EPA . 
Both the EPA statement on potential funding from an NPL listing and enforcement tools that may be available 
from listing are consistent with the explanation of the limited significance of the NPL outlined in the Federal 
Register  notice proposing this Site to the NPL (89 FR 16498). 
 Regarding the information and data used to support the proposed addition of the Site to the NPL, please see 
section 3.3, Adequacy of Documentation, of this support document for a detailed discussion.  
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  
 
3.3 Adequacy of Documentation  
Comment: TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens asserted that insufficient data or documentation were 
available to support placing the Site on the NPL.  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 15  TAI and Stevens County commented that the Site has been extensively studied as part of the RI/FS and these data 
were not included in the HRS scoring of the Site. TAI commented that the HRS is not appropriate for the Site 
because of the extensive investigation already completed for the Site. Stevens County stated that the HRS scoring 
is incomplete. TAI stated that the HRS scoring “did not incorporate the bulk of the RI/FS data” and used “arbitrarily limited data and completed studies” despite the availabilit y of additional technical information that is 
sometimes more current and comprehensive. Stevens County also commented that prior data are available from the RI/FS process on the Upper Columbia River. TAI asserted that the most recent data from the RI/FS sh ould be 
used to reflect the current risk posed by the Site.   In discussing the data used, Stevens County stated that the HRS scoring used “other unscientific data to list the 
area on the NPL.” Stevens County commented that HRS scoring should be completed based on the known risk 
associated with the Site as opposed to “guesses.” Stevens County commented that data for compounds and metals 
other than lead used in the documentation to support the proposed listing were not provided to it.  
 
Stevens County and 10 citizens made additional assertions regarding the adequacy of the supporting 
documentation. Stevens County asserted that it is unclear why the Site achieved an NPL eligible HRS site score given that no human health risk is associated with the Site and no c onclusive data on sediment contamination 
from the Upper Columbia River are present. Four  citizens commented that the proposed designation lacks 
scientific evidence to support the decision. Four  citizens commented that placing the Site on the NPL prior to the 
completion of the RI/FS suggests that the decision is being made without important data. Three citizens commented that there is a lack of scientific data to support the NPL designation or scope of the Site because the RI/FS process  is still underway. Two citizens expressed opposition to the proposed NPL designation until 
ongoing studies have been completed and verified. As part of the assertion that available data were incomplete, three citizens stated that there are no blood test r esults for children living in the impacted area that would support 
listing the Site on the NPL.   Regarding availability of documentation and data, one citizen commented that the five documents for review did 
not include data tables or a map. This citizen also asserted that the fact sheet appears to indicate that remediation 
occurred at the areas with higher contamination and no associated data were provided.  
 
Response : 
 The data relied upon in the HRS documentation record at proposal are of sufficient quantity and type 
for the purposes of scoring the Site and Site placement on the NPL. Relevant data for the NPL listing were 
included in the HRS documentation record referen ces at proposal and are available to the public via the Site 
docket10. Documents referenced in the HRS documentation record at proposal were available to the public upon 
request via the Region 10 S ite docket at the time of proposal  as described in the Federal Register notice proposing 
the Site to the NPL . The docket for the Site at the time of proposal was also sufficient for the public to review the 
HRS evaluation of the Site. As shown in other sections of this support document, the scoring of the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway were 
supported in the HRS documentation record at proposal and achieved an HRS site score a bove the NPL listing 
threshold of 28.50.  
The EPA used appropriate levels of data and investigation in determining the HRS score for the Site consistent 
with HRS regulation. As explained in the preamble in the Federal Register notice promulgating the 1990 HRS (55 FR 51533, December 14, 1990), Congress, in discussing the substantive standards against which HRS 
revisions could be assessed, stated:  
 
10 The EPA maintains dockets for the Site at EPA Headquarters and Region 10, which are available to the public per the 
instructions provided in the Federal Register  notice proposing the Site to the NPL (89 FR 16498 March 7, 2024). The 
documents in the EPA Headquarters docket explain the basis for the HRS evaluation of the Site (e.g., the HRS documentation 
record with scoresheets and figures, the narrative summary, etc.) and have been made available online at regulations.gov . The 
documents in the EPA Region 10 docket for the Site include the documents in the EPA Headquarters docket along with all 
reference documents identified in the HRS documentation record at proposal.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024

T
his standard is to be applied within the context of the purpose for the National Priorities List; 
i.e., identifying for the States and the public those facilities and sites which appear to warrant 
remedial actions…. Th e standard does not require the Hazard Ranking System to be equivalent to 
detailed risk assessments, quantitative or qualitative, such as might be performed as part of 
remedial actions. This standard requires the Hazard Ranking System to rank sites as accur ately as 
the Agency believes is feasible using information from preliminary assessments and site inspections.... Meeting this standard does not require long- term monitoring or an accurate 
determination of the full nature and extent of contamination at sites or the projected levels of 
exposure such as might be done during remedial investigations and feasibility studies. This provision is intended to ensure that the Hazard Ranking System performs with a degree of 
accuracy appropriate to its role in expeditiously identifying candidate s for respo nse actions . [H.R. 
Rep. No. 962, 99th Cong. 2nd Sess. at 199-200 [1986]]  
 
In addition, the HRS documentation record at proposal explained that other data that were not used in the HRS 
scoring of the Site were available and included in the references supporting the HRS documentation record at proposal. These data were not include d in the scoring or in the body of the HRS documentation record itself due 
to the volume of available data but were available to the public in the HRS documentation record references at the time of proposal. The Site achieved an HRS score sufficient to war rant NPL listing based on the HRS scoring 
presented in the HRS documentation record at proposal and the cited reference documents used to support that scoring. Additional data were not necessary for the HRS scoring of the Site to achieve and NPL -qualifying site 
score but were included in the record for the Site as additional evidence supporting the presence of Site- related 
contamination in sediments. Page 76 of the HRS  documentation record at proposal stated:  
 
Additional Sediment samples confirming an Observed Release by Chemical Analysis :  
 It should be noted that there are additional sediment samples from the 2019 Teck Phase 3 
Sediment Study which meet the criteria for an observed release to surface water; however, they 
were not included due to the sheer volume of data. These samples were not included because they 
were collected near sediment samples already included in documenting an observed release to 
surface water. In addition, the current samples and associated data used resulted in a maximized score of the surface water migration pathway. These sediment samples and associated data are 
included in References 35 and 36.
 
 Moreover, although these additional data provide supplementary information regarding the Site,  these data were 
not necessary to score the Site because the data relied upon sufficiently documented that the Site achieved an 
NPL -eligible HRS site score of 28.50 or greater. As shown throughout this support document, the comments 
submitted have not identified errors in the HRS factor values that would result in the Site score falling below the listing threshold of 28.50. The Site qualifies for addition to the NP L because it has achieved an HRS score greater 
than 28.50, as is demonstrated in the HRS documentation record and this support document. This score is based on the facts presented in the HRS documentation record and this support document. Achieving a site score of 
28.50 or greater indicates that the Site is eligible for inclusion on the NPL and therefore warrants further 
investigation.  
 
Regarding the citizen ’s comments asserting that data tables  were not provided  at proposal, the HRS 
documentation record at proposal included data tables summarizing the data relied on to score relevant HRS factors. The HRS documentation record at proposal was made available to the public on regulations.gov at the 
time of proposal and in the EPA Headquarters and EPA Region 10 dockets. References supporting the HRS scoring of the Site, including source documents for the analytical data, were identified in the HRS documentation 
record at proposal’s reference list and were available to the public, upon request, at the time of proposal via the 
EPA Region 10 Site docket.   
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 17  This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.4 Site Description and Definition 
Comment : Several commenters submitted comments concerning the general description of the Site, and whether 
the Site as scored is consistent with prior EPA communications and investigations. TAI commented that the proposed Site is inconsistent with the EPA’s public communications for moving forward with the proposal for adding the Site to the NPL, which have centered on residential soil contamination. TAI commented that, while 
soil contamination near Northport was emphasized in communications to the public, the HRS documentation 
record at proposal instead focused on the concentration of metals in sediment s. TAI stated that “[i]n fact, EPA 
omitted all but a small portion of the upland areas from the HRS scoring entirely, with the score premised on the Upper Columbia River.”  
 
The Government of Canada commented that the 2006 Settlement Agreement to conduct the RI/FS and a 
description of the ongoing RI/FS should be included in the HRS documentation record and “introductory 
remarks.”  
 Stevens County commented on a perceived difference between the EPA’s communication and the Site as scored, 
stating:  
 
The scoring of this proposal is arbitrary and capricious, or at the very least is skewed to fit the desired outcome of NPL listing as a priority site. We have received no communications on 
contamination on river sediment, yet the scoring to list this site seems to be based on river 
sediment data as opposed to the uplands area where lead levels are a little higher and the ninth 
circuit court of appeals has ruled that air deposition is not the responsibility of the Tech [sic] 
smelter in Canada to clean up and studies have been done. The messaging and purpose of this 
proposed listing is to clean up the higher lead levels in the Uplands Residential areas where 
studies have been conducted and no responsible party exists for clean up of residential properties 
near Northport and the Canadian Border.  Yet this messaging to us local governments and citizens 
throughout the area was only based on the Uplands data.  
 Stevens County also asserted that the EPA’s messaging has focused on lead contamination, while the information 
supporting the proposed listing of the Site includes other compounds and metals in addition to lead.  
 
Response: The HRS documentation record at proposal sufficiently described the Site as evaluated for HRS 
scoring purposes and provided sufficient description for the purpose of identifying the Site for possible NPL placement.  
 As indicated on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, for HRS scoring purposes, the Site is the release of metals  to the Upper Columbia River and soil from former operations at the two smelters , Cominco and 
Le Roi. The Site was described on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal as being located in the northeast portion of Washington State and contaminated due to historical disposal and discharges of wastes and 
emissions from smelter operations, and comingling in soils and surfac e water sediments. Sediments in the river 
are contaminated with slag and metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc, and a significant quantity of slag still remains in the Upper Columbia River. Upland soils at the Site are 
contaminated with metals including arsenic and lead. The HRS evaluation of the Site scored the surface water 
migration pathway based on concentrations of hazardous substances in sediments in the Upper Columbia River 
and the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway based on the concentrations of hazardous substances in soil.  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 18  The Site description presented in the HRS documentation record at proposal was intended to describe the Site 
based on the information used to complete the HRS scoring of the Site. Page 1 of the HRS documentation record 
at proposal elaborated on the location and description of the Site explaining that, “[t] he street address, 
coordinates, and contaminant locations.… represent one or more locations EPA considers to be part of the site 
based on the screening information EPA used to evaluate the site for Nationa l Priorities List (NPL) listing.” The 
description of the Site in the HRS documentation record was also not a final determination of what composes the 
entire Site, because, as also explained on page 1, “HRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release merely 
represent the initial determination that a certain area may need to be addressed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). ” Regardless of prior descriptions of the 
contamination, the subject of this rule making  is the evaluation of the Site for HRS scoring purposes, which is the 
Site as described in the HRS documentation record at proposal and which meets the HRS definition of a site.   
The Site was properly described  and defined in the HRS documentation record at proposal , consistent with the  
HRS.  For HRS purposes, a site is defined in HRS Section 1.1, Definitions, as: 
  
Area(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has 
otherwise come to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area 
between sources.  
 Page 1 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated that the “EPA lists national priorities among the 
known ‘releases or threatened releases’ of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely delineated boundaries.” Page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal described the specific Site and 
stated that it: 
 
includes for HRS scoring purposes the release of metals from two smelters to the UCR and to soil. The Upper Columbia River site includes three sources: slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter, currently owned by Teck Metals Ltd. (Teck; also referred to 
in references as Teck American Incorporated [TAI]), to the UCR approximately 10 river miles 
(RMs) upstream of the international border in Trail, British Columbia (B.C.); and two sources 
(i.e., contaminated soil and sluice box discharge) associated with the former Le Roi smelter 
located in Northport, Washington.
 
 
This description of the Site meets the criteria of a site as defined by the HRS  and adequately describes the 
contamination as evaluated in the HRS documentation record at proposal.   
As these comments relate to the communication between the EPA and the public, please see section 3.2, Community Involvement, of this support document for a discussion of comments questioning the level of communication with 
the public.  
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.5 Extent of Site 
Comment : Several commenters submitted comments questioning the extent of the proposed Site. Five citizens 
stated that the Site is too extensive, asserting that the Site should be more specific. One other citizen asserted that the extent of the Site should be reduced and should not include the entire 150 miles of the Upper Columbia River from the U.S.-Canada border to the Grand Coulee Dam. Three  citizens commented that the extent of the proposed 
Site is inappropriate due to insufficient data to support the d esignation.  
 
TAI, Stevens County, and the Lincoln County Commissioners (Lincoln County) provided comments discussing 
whether contamination is present in specific areas. TAI asserted that if placed on the NPL, the Site should be Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 19  limited to the Le Roi/Northport smelter facility. In discussing the ongoing investigations, Lincoln County 
commented that “[n]othing of significance has arisen in the lower parts of the lake, all the way to  
Grand Coulee Dam.” Stevens County stated that it disagreed that unidentified properties may require remediation.   
Response: The determination of the extent of the Site for HRS scoring purposes was appropriately established and 
described in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The full extent of site-related contamination, however, is not determined at the listing stage o f the CERCLA  process. The Site  boundaries may change  pending the results 
of further investigation into where the contamination has come to be located. Placing
 a site on the NPL is based 
on an evaluation, in accordance with the HRS, of a release or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. However, the fact that the EPA initially identifies and lists the release based on a 
review of contamination at a certain parcel of property (or area) does not necessarily mean that the site boundaries 
are limited to that parcel (or area).  
 CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(A) requires the EPA to list national priorities among the known “releases or 
threatened releases” of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely delineated boundaries. 
Further, CERCLA Section 101(a) defin es a “facility” as the “site” where a hazardous substance has been 
“deposited, stored, placed, or otherwise come to be located.” The “come to be located” language gives the EPA 
broad authority to clean up contamination when it has spread from the original source. On March 31, 1989 (54 FR 
13298), the EPA stated: 
 
HRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release merely represent the initial  determination that 
a certain area may need to be addressed under CERCLA. Accordingly, EPA contemplates that the preliminary description of facility boundaries at the time of scoring will need to be refined and 
improved as more information is developed as to where the contamination has come to be 
located; this refining step generally comes during the RI/FS stage. [emphasis added] 
 The revised HRS (55 FR 51587, December 14, 1990) elaborates on the “come to be located” language, defining 
“site” as “area(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has otherwise 
come to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area between the sources.”  
 Until the site investigation process has been completed and a remedial action (if any) selected, the  EPA can 
neither estimate the extent of contamination at the NPL site, nor describe the ultimate dimensions of the site. Even 
during a remedial action (e.g., the removal of buried waste) the EPA may find that the contamination has spread 
further than previously estimated, and the site definition may be correspondingly expanded.  
 
Regarding specific locations with contamination, the Site was defined in the HRS documentation record at proposal based on locations where hazardous substances were located consistent  with the HRS definition of a site. 
Page 1 of the HRS documentation record at proposal explained that the:  
 
contaminant locations presented in this Hazard Ranking System (HRS) documentation record identify the general area the site is located. They represent one or more locations EPA considers 
to be part of the site based on the screening information EPA used to evaluate the site for 
National Priorities List (NPL) listing . 
 
In describing the specifics of the Site being scored, page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated 
that the Site includes, “ the release of metals from two smelters to the UCR and to soil ” and “three sources.” This 
page continued that the three sources include:  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 20  slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter  … to the UCR approximately 
10 river miles (RMs) upstream of the international border in Trail, British Columbia (B.C.); and 
two sources (i.e., contaminated soil and sluice box discharge) associated with the former Le Roi 
smelter . 
 
Page 14 indicated that the three sources “have been documented to contain metals, including antimony, arsenic, 
cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver, zinc, and mercury.” The HRS documentation record at proposal 
explained where the contamination is located (in surface water sediments in the Upper Columbia River and in 
nearby soil) and the specific hazardous substances in the contamination being evaluated. Accordingly, the HRS documentation record at proposal sufficiently identified the extent of the Site f or the purpose of HRS scoring and 
NPL placement. See also section 3.4, Site Description and Definition, of this support document, for further discussion of the Site description.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.6 Comingled Contamination  
Comment : TAI commented that inclusion of the Northport area as part of the Site is inappropriate and 
inconsistent with historical treatment of that area as a separate site. TAI asserted that the EPA’s public 
communications have focused on the soil contamination i n the Northport area which is a separate site unrelated to 
the Cominco  smelter. TAI stated that it disagreed with the inclusion of two separate sites as part of the Upper 
Columbia River site for NPL designation purposes. TAI distinguished the two, s tating that “ the Upper Columbia 
River/Lake Roosevelt Site surrounds the town of Northport, Washington, located approximately 7 river miles downstream of the U.S.- Canada border.” It asserted that Northport has been treated as a separate site in other 
instances, such as the exclusion of the Northport area fro m the  RI/FS residential sampling. TAI commented that 
the scoring approach used could cause “confusion around what ‘the site’ it aims to list actually is.” TAI disagreed with the scoring of the Site based on comingled contamination, stating: 
 
EPA has discretion to score different portions of a site: EPA guidance11 indicates that when 
multiple sources are in an area, the EPA Regional Office must decide whether to treat the area as 
one site or as several sites for HRS scoring purposes.6 EPA Region 10 now apparently considers 
Northport part of the Upper Columbia River/Lake Roosevelt Site, on the basis that emissions from the Trail smelter 20 miles away have “commingled” with contamination from the former Le 
Roi/Northport smelter. TAI disa grees with this assertion based on extensive work done as part of 
the RI/FS, which shows that, as expected, the material impact of aerial emissions from the Trail 
smelter are localized around the smelter in British Columbia and a few miles into Washington .
12 
[61, 61a, 62] 
 
Response : The HRS documentation record at proposal appropriately evaluated the Site as the comingled 
contamination from historical releases associated with the Cominco and Le Roi smelters. While the Site is the comingled contamination from releases from the two smelters, the HRS documentation record at proposal also 
documented that both releases associated with Cominco and Le Roi smelters would independently achieve an 
NPL qualifying HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately (see Appendix A of the HRS 
documentation record at proposal). These independent releases from the two smelters comingled in surface water 
and via air deposition to soil. (See pages 14, 77-78, and 96- 97 of the HRS documentation record at proposal.) 
Therefore, listing this Site as presented in the HRS documentation record at proposal is consistent with the intent

 21  of CERCLA as it evaluates the overlapping threat posed by the comingled releases from the former smelter 
operations.  
 
In discussing the function of the NPL, CERCLA Section 105 (a)(8)(B) (as modified by SARA) directs the establishment of the NPL:  
 
Based upon the criteria set forth in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the President shall list as 
part of the plan national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases throughout the 
United States,... In assembling or revising the nationa l list, the President shall consider any 
priorities established by the states. To the extent practicable, [at least four hundred of] the highest 
priority facilities shall be designated individually and shall be referred to as the “top priority 
among known response targets”  
 Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the National Contingency Plan (NCP) 
include: 
  
[C]riteria  for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United 
States for the purpose of taking remedial action and, to the extent practicable, take into account the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action.  
 To direct implementation of CERCLA (and SARA), the EPA revised the NCP (40 CFR part 300). Section 300.5, Definitions, of the NCP lists the definitions in CERCLA and adds others. It defines the National Priorities List as:  
 
National Priorities List (NPL) means the list, compiled by EPA pursuant to CERCLA section 
105, of uncontrolled hazardous substance releases that are priorities for long- term remedial 
evaluation and response.  
 
The HRS definition of a site is centered on where contamination has come to be located and may include consideration of more than one area. HRS Section 1.1, Definitions , provides the definition for a site and directs 
that a site can include multiple areas. The HRS defines the term site
 as: 
 
Area(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has 
otherwise come to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area 
between sources.  
 
Hence, the focus of the listing is on the release and the EPA has scored the overall comingled release from the 
two smelters based on information available for a complete HRS evaluation. In addition, the EPA provided a 
supplemental scoring in the HRS documentation record at proposal in Appendix A showing each smelter’s release 
would achieve an HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately .  
 As explained throughout the HRS documentation record at proposal, the Site is the release of metals from the two 
smelters ( Cominco  and Le Roi) to the Upper Columbia River and to soil : 
  
• The Site Summary section on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed that the Site includes for HRS scoring purposes the release of metals from two smelters to the Upper Columbia 
River and to soil . It identified that releases from the three scored sources (Cominco slag discharges, Le 
Roi sluice box discharges, and contaminated soil at the former Le Roi facility) have resulted in comingled 
contamination in the Upper Columbia River. It also identified aerial deposition released from both 
smelters has become comingled in the AOC soil contamination.  
• The Attribution section for the surface water migration pathway on pages 77-78 of the HRS 
documentation record at proposal discussed the nearly continuous contamination in the 35- mile stretch of Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 22  the river encompassing the zone of contamination scored, and the comingling of the two smelters’ 
releases to surface water at and downstream of the Le Roi smelter.  
• The Attribution section for the soil exposure component on pages 96-97 of the HRS documentation 
record  at proposal discussed airborne emissions from the two smelters, including operations/emissions 
from Le Roi and air quality/deposition modeling and analysis for emissions from the Cominco smelter to 
the greater Upper Columbia River Basin over an 85- year period.  
 The inclusion  of the Northport area within the scope of  the S ite in the NPL listing is appropriate. The EPA 
conducted a removal site evaluation of the Le Roi s melter  in 2003 and a removal action in 2004. The RI/FS work 
did not begin until after the removal action at Le Roi s melter  began. Thus, the  Le Roi smelter location of the  2003 
removal action was, at that time, considered a separate site. The purpose of the RI/FS for the Upper Columbia 
River site is to determine the nature and extent of contamination, which includes the Le Roi smelter . In 2015, T AI 
disputed a direction from  the EPA and, as part of the dispute resolution, the EPA agreed to reduce the area of soil 
sampling T AI was required to do. The EPA did not require T AI to sample in the Northport town proper in 2016. 
However, the EPA did not exclude Northport from any future sampling or  response action s. 
 As noted above, both the Cominco and Le Roi smelter  releases would independently achieve an NPL qualifying 
HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately. While both smelters independently achieve an NPL 
eligible HRS site score, the threat to the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure and subsurface 
intrusion pathway is the result of comingled releases from the operations at the smelters.   
 TAI’s claim that aerial emissions from the Cominco smelter are localized around the smelter in British Columbia 
and a few miles into Washington is incorrect . TAI cites its October 2023 Upper Columbia River Draft Final 
Remedial Investigation Report for OU 3 as the  basis for  these statements. The EPA disapproved this report on 
April 9, 2024, for multiple reasons includ ing TAI ’s mistaken assertions concerning  the geographic limitation of 
aerial metals emissions from the Cominco  smelter.  The full extent of the upland soil contamination is not known, 
and the EPA is pursuing further investigations.   
Finally, even if the comingling of Cominco/Le Roi releases in contamination in the soil at Northport were not 
considered and the soil exposure component were not scored, the Site would still achieve an NPL- qualifying HRS 
site score of 28.50 or greater base d solely on the comingled surface water contamination and the surface water 
migration pathway score (i.e., the surface water migration pathway yields a pathway score of 100.00, which would result by itself in a site score of 50.00).  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.7 Liability 
Comment: TAI, Stevens County, and two citizens commented on the presence of PRPs and/or liability for the 
contamination scored. TAI commented that some of the upland soil contamination along the Upper Columbia 
River is related to impacts from the Le Roi/Northport  smelter and unrelated to the Cominco  smelter and Teck. 
TAI asserted that as the release associated with the Le/Roi Smelter lacks a solvent PRP, the Site should be limited to the impacts from the Le Roi smelter. TAI commented that following the Settlement Agreement, Teck has made 
continual progress on the RI/FS. Stevens County stated that a PRP is not present for the residential soil 
contamination around Northport. Additionally, two citizens commented that involvement from Canada is needed to address the issue as contamination is coming from Canada.  
 
Response : The NPL listing process is separate from a determination of liability, and liability is not considered in 
evaluating a site under the HRS. The NPL serves primarily as an informational tool for use by the EPA in identifying those sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health or the environment. Listing a site on 
the NPL does not reflect a judgment on the activities of the owner(s) or operator(s) of a site. It does not require Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 23  those persons to undertake any action, nor does it assign any liability to any person. This position, stated in the 
legislative history of CERCLA, has been explained more fully in the Federal Register  (48 FR 40674, September 
8, 1983, and 53 FR 23988, June 24, 1988). See Kent County v. EPA, 963 F.2d 391 (D.C. Cir. 1992  Furthermore, the presence or absence of a PRP (solvent or otherwise) or the absence of involvement from other 
parties are not factors considered in determining whether to place a site on the NPL . Evaluating whether this Site 
is eligible for proposal to the NPL is based on the technical analysis set forth in the HRS and explained in the HRS documentation record at proposal. Comments about funding for site remediation are addressed in section 
3.8, Funding, of this support document.  
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.8 Funding 
Comment: TAI, Stevens County, Benton County, and several citizens submitted comments discussing sources and 
uses of funding for remedial work.  
 
TAI commented that an RI/FS is ongoing and fully funded. TAI asserted that if NPL designation is pursued, then 
the Site should be limited to the Le Roi/Northport smelter due to its lack of a solvent PRP.   
TAI asserted that while the EPA’s news release about the proposed addition of the Site to the NPL suggested that 
NPL placement allows the EPA access to funding via the Superfund program, the process of NPL designation 
only makes non- federal sites eligible for federal funding, and that NPL listing makes sites eligible for this funding 
but does not guarantee it. TAI commented that: 
 
• Only non-federal sites are eligible for funding via the Superfund program following placement on the 
NPL.  
• Other funding mechanisms are required to be pursued by the NCP prior financing remedial actions via the Superfund.  
• Actual funding via the Superfund program is determined through specific prioritization factors. 
• This Site is unlikely to be prioritized for funding due to the limited risk posed by the Site compared other sites.  
• Funding, if awarded, may not be immediately available.  
 
Stevens County, Benton County, and five  citizens asserted that the motivation behind the pursuit of an NPL 
designation for the Site is to obtain funding. Stevens County stated that it disagreed that adding the entire area to the NPL would result in funding for remedial actions. Stevens County st ated that “references to tapping into IIJA 
[Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ] dollars” for this Site have been made. Five citizens asserted that 
including this Site on the NPL would be an inappropriate use of tax dollars. One citizen commented that funding should be in the form of grants to allow the community to make improvements that will work at a local level. Five 
citizens commented that political power associated with funding is another motivation behind the placement of the Site on the NPL. One citizen asserted that placing the Site on the NPL could become a major cost to 
taxpayers. Benton County asserted that the idea that NPL listing will lead to cleanup funding is flawed because it 
is based on the assumption that public health/environmental concerns will be identified (which is inconsistent 
with RI/FS findings so far).  
 
Response: Insomuch as these comments are related to sources of funding for future or ongoing remedial activities, 
sources of funding for remedial activities are not a factor considered in evaluating whether the NPL placement of a site is warranted. The costs associated with future or ongoing remedial actions are not determined as part of the Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 24  listing stage of the CERCLA process. The discussion of costs in NPL rules in the Federal Register  clearly states 
that including a site on the NPL does not cause the EPA necessarily to undertake remedial action; it does not 
require any action by a private party, nor does it assign liability for site response costs (56 FR 21462, May 9, 
1991). The cost discussion outlines the EPA’s perception of average potential costs per site that may occur in association with events generally following the proposed listing of a site. Any EPA actions that may impose costs 
on entitie s are based on discretionary decisions and are made on a case-by- case basis. Also, responsible parties 
may bear some or all the costs of the RI/FS and subsequent work, or the costs may be shared by the EPA and the 
States. Therefore, expenditures cited by the commenter are associated with events that generally follow  listing the 
site, not with the listing itself. The EPA has not allocated costs for this Site at this time.   
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.9 Economic Impact and Stigma of Listing 
Comment : Stevens County, Lincoln County, SCBID , QCBID , ECBID , and 21 citizens expressed concern 
regarding potential economic impacts to the region. In discussing possible economic impacts, Stevens County, QCBID, SCBID, ECBID, and 10 citizens expressed concern for one or more of the following:  
 
• Possible decreases in property values  
• Possible changes in taxation and/or shifting tax burdens  
• Negative impacts to local business  
• Decreases in local tourism and/or local recreation  
• Impacts to agriculture and/or global trade markets for food products  
 The SCBID, QCBID, ECBID, and one citizen also stated that because local farms irrigate crops with water from 
the Columbia River, crops from the region may be stigmatized resulting in negative economic impacts to 
agriculture businesses. The SCBID, QCBID, and ECBID also asserted that the resulting decreases to agriculture businesses could cascade and affect national food supply and/or global trade markets.  
 
In addition, four citizens commented that economic concerns could occur, asserting  previous economic impacts 
have occurred to the local industry (e.g., logging) because  of the protection of the spotted owl as an endangered 
species.  
 
Response: The EPA notes that there are both costs and benefits that can be associated with listing a site. The 
potential stigma and economic impacts identified by the commenters, however, are not considered in the 
assessment of whether a site belongs on the NPL. Such impacts are not the result of NPL listing. Instead, potential negative impacts associated with listing the Site, as noted by the commenter, would be engendered by the 
contamination in the area, not by placing the Site on the NPL. Furthermore, inclusion of a site or facility on the 
NPL reflects the EPA’s judgment that a significant release or threat of release has occurred and that the site is a 
priority for further investigation under CERCLA.  
 Among the benefits associated with listing a site are increased health and environmental protection as a result of 
increased public awareness of potential hazards. In addition to the potential for federally financed remedial actions, the addition of a site to the NPL could accelerate privately financed, v oluntary cleanup efforts. Listing 
sites as national priority targets also can give States increased support for funding responses at particular sites. As 
a result of the additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower human exposure to high- risk chemicals, and 
access to higher quality surface water, groundwater , soil , and air . Therefore, it is possible that any perceived or 
actual negative fluctuations in property values, stigma, or development opportunities that may result from 
contamination may also be countered by positive fluctuations when a CERCLA investigation and any ne cessary 
cleanup are completed. For further information, see information in the September 2000 EPA fact sheet, Superfund Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 25  Today, How Can a Superfund Site Affect My Property? (EPA 540 -F-98-001, available at 
https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/927384.pdf ).  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  
3.10 Purpose of Listing 
Comment: TAI, Stevens County, Lincoln County, QCBID, SCBID, ECBID, the Rimrock Cabin Owners 
Association, and several citizens submitted comments discussing the purpose and rationale for listing.  
 
Purpose of NPL Listing  
TAI requested that the purpose of listing be clarified, including the benefits and limitations. TAI asserted that 
statements have been made that incorrectly suggest that additional enforcement authority is provided via NPL 
placement and that these types of  statements provide misinformation about the status of a proposed NPL site. TAI 
commented that NPL designation does not provide additional enforcement authority. TAI commented that a Washington State Department of Ecology staff member made a statement sugg esting that an NPL designation for 
the Site would end an ongoing litigation.
13  
 
TAI stated that an RI/FS is ongoing for this Site in contrast to most sites, which are typically considered for NPL placement at the preliminary assessment (PA) stage. TAI commented that HRS scoring is a site evaluation process 
intended “for a relatively q uick, limited assessment based on high- level data available in the early days of 
understanding the site.” It asserted that HRS scoring is not intended to account for extensive site- specific data. 
TAI stated that the HRS Guidance Manual notes that HRS score s are intended to reflect the threat at the time of 
scoring. TAI commented that the ongoing RI/FS will determine the need for remedial action and the specific 
actions necessary.  
 Need for Listing  
Several commenters provided comments discussing whether a need for listing the Site on the NPL had been established. F ive citizens commented that a need for the proposed NPL designation of the Site had not been 
provided. In discussing results of prior investigations, Lincoln County commented that no significant issues have 
been found for lower parts of Lake Roosevelt to the Grand Coulee Dam. A citizen commented that it is unclear 
what remediation of the Site will accomplish.  Three citizens asserted that the designation appeared to be 
motivated by the pursuit of funding. Three citizens also commented that a Superfund designation will shift 
political power over a large part of Eastern Washington to the State and local tribes. A citizen asserted that 
without coordination with the Government of Canada, the issue of contamination in the Upper Columbia River 
will remain. The QCBID, SCBID, and ECBID asserted that alternative approaches to remediate the soil 
contamination that are being identified in the RI/FS should  be pursued. Lincoln County commented that 
alternatives should be pursued to address issues identified in the lower portion of Lake Roosevelt.   Stevens County asserted that NPL placement of the Site is premature and the process of completing the RI/FS 
prior to placing the Site on the NPL should be followed. Stevens County commented that the process should also 
be followed because the new EPA guida nce on lead levels in soil is inconsistent with the screening levels for 
metals in Washington state. Stevens County asserted that placing the Site on the NPL at this time would eliminate the determination of whether remedial work would exacerbate the threat to human health and public safety. It also 
commented that NPL placement at this stage would eliminate the examination of which remedial methods are 
most appropriate.  
 
 
13 TAI points to statements made by Brook Beeler, Eastern Regional Manager at the Washington State Department of 
Ecology, as shown in an article from the Roll Call newspaper, available at https://rollcall.com/2024/04/10/superfund- plan-
for-columbia -river -sparks -debate- in-northwest/ .  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 26  One citizen commented that other areas may be in a greater need of remediation and funding for remediation. 
Another citizen asserted that listing would cause adverse public health impacts as a result of an economic 
downturn.  
 Remedy Decision/ Remedial Actions  
The Rimrock Cabin Owners Association and 14 citizens submitted comments providing suggested remedial actions. These concerns about future remediation from the Rimrock Cabin Owners Association and the citizens 
included comments that:  
 
• Remediation of the sediment in the Columbia River could lead to a greater exposure to contamination if sediment is disturbed.  
• Additional unbiased testing to determine high levels of contamination should occur before remediation begins.  
• Documentation that the proposed remedial work will result in improved conditions should be required.  
• Unique solutions for remediation and additional planning should be considered.  
• Smelters should be shut down and modified.  
• Instead of removing the dam, adding fish ladders is a more appropriate mitigation approach and will not impact agriculture in the area.  
• Remedial work should be focused on a specific area as opposed to a broader geographic area.  
• Remedial work could negatively impact the lake and river area.  
• Cleanup should be completed on an area-specific basis accounting for the risk to human health or 
wildlife.  
 
Response : The purpose of listing a site on the NPL is to inform the public of a possible threat posed by a site that 
warrants further investigation. The EPA’s actions to evaluate the Upper Columbia River site using the HRS and 
listing the Site are consistent with the requirements of CERCLA and SARA, and the statutory purpose of the 
NPL.  
 
Placing the Site on the NPL is not an announcement of any site- specific risk level or a determination of the need 
for remedial action. Listing a site reflects the EPA’s decision to inform the public of the possible threat posed by the site and at a later stage in the CERCLA  process the EPA will determine what, or if, cleanup  action is 
warranted. An HRS site score above 28.50 for the Upper Columbia River site represents the EPA’s determination that the Site poses a relative risk as compared to other sites evaluated under the HRS and that the Site warrants further investigation  and potential remediation. At this Site, hazardous substances, including antimony, arsenic, 
cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, zinc, and mercury, were identified in a release to surface water, and lead and arsenic were identified in contaminated soil ; the relative risk posed by this contamination is reflected in the HRS 
scoring of the surface water migration pathway and soil exposure component in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The contamination documented in sediments and surface soil has the potential to affect human health 
and/or the environment. The need for remedial action to address the sediment and soil contamination will be assessed during later stages of the CERCLA process.  
 
Purpose of NPL Listing  
The NPL is generally intended to be a “rough list” of prioritized hazardous sites; a “first step in a process —
nothing more, nothing less.” Eagle Picher Indus. v. EPA, 759 F.2d 922, 932 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Eagle Picher II). 
The HRS is the mechanism used to evaluate the relative risk of a site. If a site scores 28.50 or greater using the HRS, then it may be added to the NPL.  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 27  The purpose of NPL listing is explained in the Federal Register  Notice of February 21, 1990 (Volume 55, 
Number 35), excerpted below:  
 
The purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informational and management 
tool. The initial identification of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide EPA in 
determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of the public 
health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA -financed 
remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of si tes 
EPA believes warrant further investigation.  
 
Addition of the Site to the NPL thus indicates further investigation is warranted to fully assess the extent of risk 
posed by the Site (and remedial actions may be selected based on the findings of that complete assessment).  
 Need  for Listing  
Sufficient basis for placing the Site on the NPL has been established. The Site qualifies for addition to the NPL because it has achieved an HRS score equal to or greater than 28.50, as is demonstrated in the HRS documentation record and this support document. Achieving a site score of 28.50 or greater indicates that the Site  
is eligible for inclusion on the NPL and therefore warrants further investigation. Placing a site on the NPL allows the EPA to more effectively prioritize sites and manage possible fut ure site investigations  and response actions; it 
also notifies the public that the release at a site is of concern to the Agency. The HRS score for the Site is based on the release of contamination documented in sediment s in the surface water migration pathway and soil 
contamination in the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, the 
contaminants present, and the targets subject to actual and potential contamination, consistent with th e HRS. The 
HRS site score above 28.50 presents sufficient need for NPL placement and establishes that the Site poses sufficient relative risk to warrant further investigation.  As explained in detail in section 3.15, Risk to Human 
Health and the Environment, of this support document, the HRS evaluation of a site is not a risk assessment and 
not intended to provide a specific determination of risk. Rather, the specific risk posed by the Site is determined at 
a separate stage in the CERCLA  process.  
 Remedy Decision/ Remedial Actions  
Placement of a site on the NPL is not an evaluation of the effectiveness of any remedy currently in place or a 
determination of whether specific remedial actions are appropriate. T he EPA has a procedure for identifying sites 
where releases of substances addressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the 
NPL, evaluating the nature and extent of the threats at such sites, responding to those threats, and deleting sites 
from the NPL.  The evaluation, or RI/FS phase, involves on- site testing to assess the nature and extent of the 
public health and environmental risks associated with the site, and provides information to determine what 
remedial actions, if any, may be appropriate. After a period of public comment, the EPA responds to those threats 
by issuing a Record of Decision that selects the most appropriate alternative. The selected remedy is implemented 
during the remedial design/remedial action phase. Finally, the site may be  deleted from the NPL when the EPA 
determines that no furt her response is appropriate.  
 
While the steps in the CERCLA  process are distinct, they can be conducted in parallel. For the Upper Columbia 
River site, the Site was evaluated using the HRS and received an HRS site score of 51.15, which exceeds the 
threshold for placement on the NPL. Because of an NPL eligible HRS site score, in conjunct ion with concurrence 
from the state of Washington , the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation,  and The Spokane Tribe of 
Indians , the EPA proposed the Site for listing on the NPL. Prior to proposi ng the Site on the NPL, to address the 
Site in a more timely manner, the EPA has been overseeing the conduct of an RI/FS by a PRP to evaluate the Site 
in more depth to characterize site contamination and to analyze interim remedial alternatives to address the most 
pressing threats at the Site. The EPA has also conducted or overseen implementation of time critical removal Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 28  actions to address immediate threats to public health.14 As a matter of policy, however, the EPA does not delay 
NPL listing of a site to incorporate any new data or to score new pathways if the ultimate listing decision is not 
affected.  
 
As previously noted in this support document, the selection of remedy—if any is found necessary  for some or all 
of the Site —and any associated funding is a step carried out at a later stage of the CERCLA  process.  Thus, 
comments on a remedy are premature at the listing stage.  However, placing the Site on the NPL does not prohibit 
any PRP or stakeholder from participating in cleanup efforts  as discussed in detail in section 3.14, Ongoing 
Investigation and Remediation, of this support document. The ongoing RI/FS is also discussed further in that 
section.  
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.11 Due Process  
Comment: Stevens County stated that information has been delayed or withheld to move forward with the listing 
process. Stevens County asserted that comments were solicited from select groups on the draft BERA, which is used to support some aspects of the NPL proposal of the Site. It commented that Citizens for Clean Columbia 
were provided an opportunity to comment prior to the release of the draft document, while local governments 
were not given the same opportunity to comment.  
 Stevens County also stated that the “solicitation of clean up action contracting for this process under the CERCLA 
program and NPL”
15 prior to the proposal to list the Site on the NPL suggests that “this rule- making process has a 
predetermined outcome without affording the process follow all federal guidelines.” Stevens County quoted the 
solicitation, which, in part, states: 
 
R10 Upper Columbia River Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7, Acquisition Management Branch, is seeking 
the services of an experienced firm to provide Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support services within the Upper Columbia River (UCR) Site. The primary focus of this requirement will 
be on residential properties within the Town of Northport that are affected by commingled 
contamination from smelter operations.… To achieve this, work includes: 1) an additional round 
of voluntary soil sampling at properties that have not been previously sampled; 2) complete a 
removal assessment and prioritization of properties for cleanup using data obtained during the 
current and previous sampling events; and 3) conduct time critical removal actions (TCRA) at the 
properties identified for cleanup. [A12]  
 
Response: The EPA correctly followed the HRS, complied with the requirements in the APA, and followed 
relevant procedures in determining whether to list  the Site on the NPL. The EPA has concluded that placing the 
Site on the NPL is an appropriate step in the multi- step CERCLA process.  
 
Consistent with CERCLA, the EPA has in place a procedure for identifying sites where releases of substances 
addressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the NPL, evaluating the nature and 
extent of the threats at such sites, res ponding to those threats, and deleting sites from the NPL. The purpose of the 
initial two steps is to develop the NPL, which identifies for the States and the public those sites that appear to 
 
14 See the Upper Columbia River Study Area webpage ( https://www.epa.gov/columbiariver/upper -columbia -river -study -area) 
discussion in the section titled “Residential cleanups” (as well as planning for future actions in the section “ EPA to conduct 
time-critical removal/soil cleanup action ”). 
15 Stevens County point ed to a solicitation located at: 
https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2ffedconnect%3fdoc%3d68HE0724R0014%26agency%3
dEPA&doc=68HE0724R0014&agency=EPA   Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 29  warrant remedial action (56 FR 35842, July 29, 1991). The evaluation or RI/FS phase involves on- site testing to 
assess the nature and extent of the public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine 
what alternatives for remedi al action, if any, may be appropriate. After a period of public comment following 
issuance of the RI/FS and the identification of a preferred alternative, the EPA responds to the identified threats 
by issuing a Record of Decision which selects the most appropriate alternative. The selected remedy is 
implemented during the remedial design/remedial action phase. Finally, the site may be deleted from the NPL 
when the EPA determines that no further response is appropriate.   
 This process encourages and relies on the participation of the public, including PRPs. The public can comment 
during the comment period (typically 60 days) after a site is proposed for listing and during the time the EPA is 
evaluating and selecting a remed y (the EPA may also hold a public hearing during the latter decision- making 
period). If private parties conduct a remedial action under a consent decree between the EPA and the parties, the 
decree is also subject to public comment. The EPA believes that th e above process offers the public sufficient 
opportunity to present facts and opinions germane to its decision- making.   
 
Additionally, the CERCLA  process allows the Agency to include expedited removal actions and interim measures 
to address more immediate concerns or address portions of a site. The EPA may select removal actions (such as a 
TCRA) at any time to address immediate risks to human health. (See CERCLA Section 10 4.) 
 
As further detailed in section 3.3, Adequacy of Documentation, of this support document, on the subject of the 
BERA , whether the BERA forms part of the basis for listing and the lack of opportunity for local governments to 
comment on the BERA, the HRS evaluation and HRS site score is fully supported by the references in the HRS 
documentation record at proposal , and the draft BERA is not needed to support the HRS score. The public was 
provided a 60- day comment period to review and comment on all documents supporting the listing decision,  
including the HRS documentation record at proposal and supporting references. The BERA was not included as a  
reference to the HRS documentation record at proposal  and is not needed to support the HRS score. Whether 
another group may have had an opportunity to evaluate a document not relied upon for the proposed listing of the Site is unrelated to the present listing action.  
 Regarding the solicitation identified by the commenter (“solicitation of clean up action”), the solicitation 
summary quoted above is looking for services to complete Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support 
services. Removal action support services can occur separately and be unrelated to the evaluation of whether 
placing a site on the NPL is appropriate. As identified in the HRS documentation record at proposal, removal 
actions have been conducted to address soil contamination in and around the Northport area. The volume of 
contaminated soil removed at those locations was not included in the Site for HRS scoring purposes.  Page 92 of 
the HRS documentation record at proposal explained that the “EPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area dating back to 2003,” and for the evaluation of “the hazardous waste quantity area 
and resident population for the AOC … only contaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did 
not have soil removals, were included in the calculation.” Thus, this solicitation is unrelated to the HRS 
documentation record and does not impact the site score or affect the assessment of whether placement on the 
NPL is appropriate.  Note that NPL listing allows for  CERCLA remedial action, which is different from a removal 
action (i.e., as set out in 42 U.S.C. § 9601(24), a remedial action is generally considered to include those actions 
taken that are consistent with a permanent remedy ); also, CERCLA removal actions may occur at any time on 
sites that are either on , or not on, the NPL.   
 The solicitation  referred to by the commenter  was issued to ensure that contract services are in place to support 
additional removal site evaluation and removal actions , should they be determined to be necessary, at properties 
where potential immediate  risk exists.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 30  3.12 Delay Listing Until the RI/FS is Completed 
Comment: Stevens County, the Eastern Washington Council of Governments (EWCOG), Lincoln County, 
QCBID, SCBID, ECBID, Benton County, and 22  citizens stated that placement of the Site on the NPL should not 
occur prior to the completion of an RI/FS or other similar investigation. Stevens County and one  citizen 
commented that the EPA previously stated that the Site would not be placed on the NPL until after the RI/FS is 
completed. One citizen asserted that the 2006 settlement agreement with Teck mandated certain studies be completed before NPL listing . [C15] EWCOG stated that, as a high concern is not present, delaying listing “will 
not have a detrimental effect.”  
 
Stevens County asserted that the RI/FS is ongoing, would be complete in a few years, and should be completed as 
soon as possible. Stevens County stated that placing the Site on the NPL after the RI/FS would:  
• Ensure “ reliable science- based studies to confirm there is/was an issue needing clean up”  
• Identify “specific areas for clean -up where the cleanup action would not create more harm than benefit”  
 
Stevens County and several  citizens submitted comments discussing whether the Site should be placed on the 
NPL prior to the collection of data and information from additional reports. Eight citizens stated that it is unclear 
why NPL designation is occurring without the scientific data that would result from the RI/FS. Stevens County commented that  it is unclear why NPL designation is being pursued for the entire waterbody as an EPA 
representative indicated that Lake Roosevelt meets drinking water standards except for bacteria, which have not been tested for. Stevens County asserted that pursuing listing prior to completion of the RI/FS would eliminate the 
assessment of whether remedial efforts may have negative effects and identifying which cleanup methods are 
appropriate. Stevens County commented that an FS needs to be completed to limit exposure during cleanup. 
Stevens County stated that the RI/FS investigation for ecologic health is funded and that completed human health 
studies are indicating no actions a re needed. One citizen commented that the RI/FS will provide information about 
the best remedial approach.  
 
In a letter provided to the EPA included as Attachment A to its comment submission, Stevens County requested 
that NPL listing be reconsidered. Stevens County also stated that if the EPA were to pursue an “NPL Listing 
(Superfund Designation) without completing the RI/FS studies first, you leave us with no other option but to challenge your actions in court.”  
 
Response : There is no need to delay NPL listing to wait for the results of the RI/FS investigation.  All site 
investigation work performed  to date or currently proceeding, including the ongoing RI/FS, will be considered in 
subsequent steps of the CERCLA process. The available information presented in the HRS documentation record 
at proposal establishes an HRS site score exceeding the 28.50 threshold and qualifying the Site for NPL listing 
based on the current conditions at the Site. Site -related contamination remains in sediment s and soil as 
documented in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The EPA has determined that this site- related 
contamination appears to warrant further investigation and potential remediation. Other ongoing investigations do 
not negate the need for listing. Nevertheless, the results of the Upper Columbia River RI/FS will be taken into account as part of later stages of the CERCLA process for the Site.   
 As previously indicated in section 3.11, Due Process, of this support document , and  consistent with CERCLA, the 
EPA has in place a procedure for identifying sites where releases of substances addressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the NPL, evaluating the nature and extent of the threats at such sites, responding to those threats, and deleting sites f rom the NPL. The purpose of the initial two steps is to develop the 
NPL which identifies for the States and the public those sites that appear to warrant further investigation and 
potential remedial action. The evaluation or RI/FS phase involves on- site te sting to define the nature and extent of 
the threat posed by the contamination and to identify alternatives for remedial action. The RI/FS investigation Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 31  typically occurs following listing on the NPL. (However, as noted in section 3.10, Purpose of Listing, of this 
support document, for this Site, the RI/FS has been ongoing and is proceeding in parallel with NPL listing.)  
 
Thus, the purpose of NPL listing is to identify sites warranting further investigation to fully assess the extent of 
risk posed by the site (and ultimately to evaluate and determine what CERCLA- financed remedial actions, if any, 
may be appropriate). The RI/FS identifies the extent of contamination and possible remedies to address that contamination. In this case, both steps are being done concurrently, as there is a party conducting an RI/FS 
pursuant to a settlement agreement, and, at the same time, there i s sufficient information available to justify NPL 
listing.  
 Regarding the data and documentation used to evaluate and score the Site with the HRS, sufficient data and 
documentation were used for the purposes of HRS scoring as explained in detail in section 3.3, Adequacy of 
Documentation, of this support document.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.13 Consistency with Guidance/Use of Guidance 
Comment: TAI and Stevens County submitted comments questioning aspects of EPA guidance documents and 
the application of guidance:  
 
• TAI asserted that the HRS Guidance Manual  indicates that, when addressing an area with multiple 
sources, the EPA can use its discretion to determine whether one or more sites is present for HRS scoring purposes. TAI commented that it disagreed with the EPA’s consideration of the Le Roi  smelter as a part 
of the Site due to comingling of releases.  
• In discussing EPA guidance developed using an extrapolation of Center for Disease Control (CDC) 
guidance for blood lead levels, Stevens County commented that prior blood lead studies:  
show NO elevated lead levels in children, the most vulnerable population, from the old standards prior to the new guidance. As guidance is simply that and has not been 
available for public comment, and extrapolation of data is a scientific guess with no degree [of] certainty, it draws the conclusion that lead levels of blood in the children and 
population in the area should be done prior to scoring being completed to show there is 
an issue. Scoring should be done on known risks, not guesses by those in the agency.…  
• TAI commented on the EPA’s new lead screening level guidance. It pointed to a March 5, 2024, EPA 
news release
16 in which the EPA noted that soil at more than 194 residential areas related to the Site 
involve lead at levels that exceed the new EPA screening level for residential lead contamination . TAI 
commented that guidance for the new screening level does not prescribe cleanup levels (and that site-
specific screening levels are already set).  
 
• TAI asserted that the HRS Guidance Manual indicates that releases are scored based on the threat at the 
time of scoring.  
 
Response : The EPA followed the HRS regulation to list the Site on the NPL. Furthermore, unlike the HRS 
regulation itself, the HRS Guidance Manual  and other EPA guidance are not regulations and impose no 
mandatory requirements on the Agency.

 32  Regardless, the Interim Final  HRS Guidance Manual was also applied appropriately in the HRS evaluation based 
on the facts and circumstances known to be present for this Site at proposal; any variation in applying the HRS 
Guidance Manual  was carried out to reflect site-specific conditions. The  HRS Guidance Manual states that:  
 
[t]he procedures set forth in this document are intended as guidance to employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), States, and other government agencies. EPA officials 
may decide to follow the guidance provided in this directive, or to ac t at variance with it, based 
on analysis of specific site circumstances.  
 In evaluating whether a site merits NPL listing, the EPA complies with the HRS and uses the HRS Guidance 
Manual as just that—guidance to determine how best to perform the HRS evaluation based on the facts or 
circumstances presented at each site. The HRS Guidance Manual is consistent with the HRS (this was not 
challenged by the commenters), and the EPA has followed the HRS in scoring the Site and applied the  HRS 
Guidance Manual , as appropriate, depending on the facts presented by this Site.  
 
Regarding the consideration of the Le Roi smelter as a part of the Site due to comingling of releases, the Site was 
appropriately evaluated as the comingled contamination from historical releases associated with the Cominco and 
Le Roi smelters  as discussed in detail in section 3.6, Commingled Contamination, of this support document.  
 Regarding consistency with the draft EPA’s Updated Residential Soil Lead Guidance for CERCLA Sites and 
RCRA Corrective Action Facilities
17 guidance document, this document is intended to only provide 
recommendations and present guidance on evaluating sites at stages unrelated to the listing stage of the CERCLA  
process. This guidance document provides residential soil lead regional screening levels (RSLs) and regional removal management levels (RMLs), which are used during other stages of the CERCLA  process for remedial 
and removal actions. Further, these screening levels are not used in the HRS evaluation and therefore have no impact on the HRS score.   
Regarding the absence of elevated blood lead levels, the HRS does not require blood lead sampling in scoring 
sites for NPL listing  nor require inclu sion of blood lead levels directly in  any of the HRS factors. Additionally, the 
EPA also  does  not require , or encourage, blood lead sampling for CERCLA risk assessments as indicated in EPA 
guidance.
18 The EPA ’s mission is to protect human health and the environment by prevent ing adverse health 
effects from pollution . The EPA does not require evidence of elevated blood lead levels before HRS scoring  of a 
site or taking actions to protect human health. Please see section, 3.15, Risk to Human Health and the 
Environment, of this support document for additional discussion of blood lead level studies.  
 
Regarding the comments suggesting that a determination of a specific level of risk associated with the Site be made, as noted above, the Site was evaluated using the HRS regulation which is a screening tool intended to 
provide a limited evaluation of a sit e. The determination of site- specific risk occurs at a separate stage of the 
CERCLA process, and comments discussing the possible risk posed by the Site are addressed in section 3.15, Risk to Human Health or the Environment, of this support document.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.14 Ongoing Investigation and Remediation  
Comment: TAI, the Government of Canada, and two citizens commented that extensive remediation and 
investigation of the Site have occurred and are ongoing. TAI commented that an RI/FS is ongoing, the BERA is

Corrective Action Sites , is available online at https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/11/100000158 . Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
33 ongoing, and the human health risk assessment (HHRA) has been completed. TAI stated that the HRS “ approach  
largely does not account for the extensive RI/FS work already done.” As part of the comments provided by TAI 
on the robust nature of the remedial work Teck has been completing, it commented that:  
•Th
e HHRA indicated that unacceptable levels of contamination are not present in surface water and fish
from the Upper Columbia River.
•Many of the residential properties with lead -contaminated soil above the EPA action levels have been
remediated.
•The work completed as part of the ongoing RI/FS included a Tribal consumption and use survey and arecreational use survey.
•The draft BERA for the aquatic portion of the Site has been submitted and is a comprehensive aquaticecologic risk assessment
•Analysis of thousands of samples from the Site has occurred.
•Multiple types of environmental media have been sampled and assessed.
TA
I and the Government of Canada submitted comments pointing to the ongoing RI/FS. The Government of 
Canada stated that “[i]t is expected that the results included in these reports will provide essential data on the 
extent and magnitude of risks as well as identify data gaps for future studies,” and it noted that a hydro-dynamic 
model may provide additional data regarding the transport of slag in the river. The Government of Canada 
requested that the nature and extent of the completed and on- going remedial work be clearly stated. TAI also 
stated that “the nature and necessity of any final remedial action will be determined on a site- specific basis in the 
RI/FS.” It commented that the aquatic RI report is ongoing and the FS and Records of Decision will occur following the RI.
19  
As p
art of its comments regarding the extensive remedial work completed for the Site and the evaluation of the 
Site, TAI asserted that the HRS is an inappropriate tool for evaluating a site with extensive completed remedial 
work and available data. TAI stated that while evaluating NPL placement in the early stages of site assessment is 
appropriate,20 the function of listing to serve as a quick and inexpensive tool21 for assessing sites does not apply to 
a site like the Upper Columbia River, which already has extensive data and an ongoing RI/FS. It commented that unlike this Site where investigation has been occurring for 20 years, NPL placement usually occurs early i n the 
site evaluation process. It asserted that NPL placement typically also does not occur where a funded on -going 
RI/FS is occurring. 
TA
I commented that while the EPA’s stated primary concern is reducing residential exposure to lead in soil, the 
EPA also noted that NPL listing would not change the process, investigation, or remediation, culminating in the 
remediation of both upland soil and aquatic areas associated with the Site.22 In discussing the remediation process, 
TAI commented that an RI/FS is already mandated as part of a Settlement Agreement between EPA and Teck.  
Response : The  EPA has determined that listing the Site on the NPL is the next appropriate step in the CERCLA 
process. Future remedial actions are not considered during the HRS evaluation of the Site because an HRS site score is based on current conditions . Here, the Site warrants placement on the NPL as evidenced by the Site 
achieving an HRS site score above the listing threshold based on an assessment of the current conditions.  
19 TAI pointed to Attachment A of its comment submissi on, which includes a timeline of related RI/FS work.  
20 TAI quoted Carus Chem. Co. v. EPA , 395 F.3d 434, 437 (D.C. Cir. 2005) to support the nature of  an NPL designation only 
ensuring additional study.  
21 TAI quoted Wash. State Dep’t of Transp. v. EPA , 917 F.2d 1309, 1310 (D.C. Cir.1990) to support that the listing stage of 
the CERCLA process is a tool for identifying sites warranting further study.  
22 TAI pointed to Attachments B And C of its comment submission, which include copies of the EPA and TAI’s 
presentations to the EWCOG.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 34   
With regard  to completed remedial work, completed removal  actions have been  considered in the assessment of 
the Site.  Although response actions may have been completed and other investigations are ongoing, the Site is still 
eligible for NPL placement, and the conditions at the Site qualify for listing as established by the Site achieving an HRS site score of 51.15. The RI/FS referenced by the commenters is ongoing per a settlement agreement. This 
settlement  agreement covers the RI/FS but does not provide  for a potential  site-wide cleanup. However, 
completed response actions and the results of ongoing investigations, including the results of the RI/FS, will be considered in subsequent stages of the CERCLA  process.  
 
Additionally, numerous completed and ongoing investigations were acknowledged in the HRS documentation 
record at proposal. Pages 14-16 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed investigations into the 
Upper Columbia River and associated soil contamination in the Northport area. Page 16 of the HRS 
documentation record at proposal discussed 
that “ numerous EPA Removal activities have occurred in the 
Northport, Washington area, including several removal site evaluations (RSEs).”   
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.15 Risk to Human Health and  the Environment 
Comment: TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens submitted comments questioning whether the Site poses a 
risk. Stevens County and eight citizens commented that the available studies do not appear to indicate a risk posed 
by the Site. Stevens County commented that except for bacteria, which have not been tested for, the Columbia 
River meets water quality standards. One citizen commented that tests to determine whether there is a risk posed 
by metal contamination have not been completed.  
 
In discussing the risks associated with the Columbia River, nine citizens commented that the water is clean and/or 
meets water quality standards. Three  citizens stated that there are no human health risks associated with the Upper 
Columbia River , the Site  and/or Lake Roosevelt. Eight citizens commented that fish are safe to consume. One 
commenter asserted the area is clean except for rubbish.  
 TAI asserted that there has been a miscommunication whether a human health risk is present associated with the 
Upper Columbia River. TAI asserted that the Columbia River does not pose a risk based on past reports. TAI 
commented that an HHRA has been completed, showing no human health risks. TAI also noted a draft BERA has 
been submitted for the aquatic portion of the Site and is a comprehensive assessment of aquatic ecological risk.  
TAI stated that the HRS documentation record at proposal focuses on metal c ontamination in sediments which 
has been determined to not pose a risk to human health. Regarding the risk posed by the Upper Columbia River, TAI commented that the river is safe, asserting that:  
 
• The water in the Columbia River is safe.  
• The beaches are safe, except for one closed beach.  
• The fish from the Columbia River are safe to consume except for largescale suckers.  
• The river has a healthy game fishery. 
• The aquatic portion of the Site does not pose actionable human health risks. 
• Risk calculations completed in the HHRA determined that contaminants of concern were not associated 
with surface water exposure pathways. 
 Commenting on the risk associated with contaminated soil, TAI asserted that, while public communications have 
conveyed that the Upper Columbia River is safe, the EPA has emphasized a possible human health risk associated 
with contaminated soil in the Northport area. TAI commented that a March 5, 2024, EPA news release refers to Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 35  soil contamination as the main risk posed by the Site and pointed to the news releases’ discussion23 of residential 
areas above the EPA’s new screening level. TAI stated that a human health risk associated with lead in residential 
soil has been emphasized and stated that “the potential justification for Listing —if there even is one—is primarily 
due to re sidential properties in and around Northport” as opposed to contamination in the Columbia River. 
Regarding soil contamination, TAI commented that:   
• The majority of properties with soil contamination above the action level have been cleaned up.  
• The RI and ecological risk assessment for the upland soil contamination is ongoing and close to completion.  
• A significant amount of work has been completed.  
• The residential soil contamination has been overstated by including non- residential areas in the scope.  
• Soil contamination affecting numerous residential properties as a result of the former Le Roi/Northport smelter operations is being addressed via removal and remedial actions.  
• Impacted upland soil contamination has been addressed to the current a ction level.  
• The potential human health risk is associated with lead in soil in a small portion of the uplands area adjacent to the former Le Roi smelter.  
• The impacts of air emissions and dusts from the Le Roi smelter have not been fully assessed and 
delineated. 
 In commenting on the risk posed by the Site based on testing of blood levels, Stevens County and EWCOG 
commented that local blood testing does not indicate a health concern. Stevens County commented that local 
studies do not indicate elevated blood levels in children, which were considered the most vulnerable group under the prior EPA guidance. Stevens County asserted that: 
 
• “[I]t draws the conclusion that lead levels of blood in the children and population in the area should be done prior to scoring being completed to show there is an issue.” 
• “Scoring should be done on known risks.”  
 
Additionally, two citizens asserted that data from blood lead level testing on children do not support NPL designation.  
 
In discussing the HRS scoring, TAI commented that the technical reasoning for the proposed listing is 
inconsistent with past EPA communication regarding the risk posed by the Site. [31] Stevens County stated that 
“[i]t is hard to know why the scores are so high to warrant listing with no human health risk and data backing up this conclusion.”  
 
Response : The EPA considers that there is a potential threat to human health and the environment posed by the 
contamination in the surface water sediments and soil and that this threat warrants further investigation  and 
potential further response actions . Consistent with CERCLA, this Site is being placed on the NPL based on an 
HRS evaluation of the risk relative to other sites being considered for the NPL resulting from the release of 
hazardous substances to the Upper Columbia River and exposure to contaminated  soil in residential yards.  
 
 
23 The news release is available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -wa-
superfund- list. TAI pointed to the following statement in the EPA’s news release, “[t]he agency has determined that soils 
contaminated with lead and arsenic pose unacceptable risk to residents at affected properties, particularly to children. EPA 
determined that soil in  at least 194 residential areas contain lead at levels that exceed the agency’s new screening level for 
residential lead contamination.”  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 36  The EPA has not assumed site- specific risks are present at this Site in determining that the Site qualifies for 
placement on the NPL. The Site achieved an HRS site score above 28.50, which demonstrates that the Site poses 
a sufficient relative risk to warr ant further investigation. The HRS is not a site -specific risk assessment; rather, it 
is a screening tool used to help the EPA determine priorities for cleanup, and possible response activities, and 
represents relative risk among sites undergoing HRS evaluation. Actual determinations of site -specific risk that is 
posed to human health or the environment are determined during a different stage of the CERCLA process.  
 
The NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation, 
potential further response action, and to  assess the nature and extent of public health and environmental risks 
associated with a release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. See 89 FR 16498 (Proposed Rule, 
Upper Columbia River, March 7, 2024); see also 55 FR 51532 (Final Rule, H azard Ranking System, December 
14, 1990) and 82 FR 2760 (Addition of Subsurface Intrusion Component to the Hazard Ranking System, January 
9, 2017). CERCLA § 105(a)(8)(a) requires the EPA to determine NPL priorities among sites based on the 
“relative risk o r danger to public health or welfare, or the environment.” The criteria the EPA applies to determine 
this relative risk or danger is codified in the HRS, and is the Agency’s primary tool for deriving a site score based on the factors identified in CERCLA. The HRS evaluation and score above 28.50 represents the EPA’s 
determination that the Site may pose a relative risk or threat to human health and the environment and warrants 
further investigation under CERCLA. As part of the standard CERCLA  process, once t he Site is on the NPL, the 
investigations performed to date to characterize the Site will be evaluated for completeness, further information will be collected if deemed necessary to adequately characterize the risks posed by the Site, and based on this 
information, a risk assessment decision will be made determining what, if any, remedial action is necessary to 
protect human health and the environment.  
 
Regarding comments asserting that there is either no risk or limited risk posed by exposure to soil at the Site, as 
noted above the specific risk posed by soil contamination at the site is not determined by an HRS evaluation. 
While risk is typically determined during a later stage of the CERCLA  process , as part of the ongoing RI/FS, 
some risk assessment s for portions of the Site  have been completed or started. The full extent of the risk posed by 
the Site has not been determined , and the potential risk pose d by the Site  will continue to be evaluated as part of 
subsequent stages of the CERCLA process.  Regardless, the HRS evaluation of the Site documented lead and 
arsenic contamination in soil that met observed contamination criteria sufficient for HRS scoring purposes. Additionally, multiple hazardous substances have been documented in surface water se diments to meet HRS 
requirements for observed release (antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc), and 
slag containing hazardous subs tances is documented to have been released directly into the Columbia River. 
These hazardous substances present in surface water sediments and in soil are in part attributable to the Site as 
listed at proposal.  
 
In 2021, the  EPA completed the  HHRA at the Site and concluded that risks associated with human exposure to 
contaminated soils exceeds risk -based benchmarks on residential and common use properties. The  EPA’s HHRA 
concluded that human ingestion of certain fish species, including large -scale suckers, exceed ed risk-based 
benchmarks. (See pages 39 and 40 of the HHRA included as Reference 17 of the HRS documentation record at 
proposal.)  
 Regarding comments discussing the risk the Site may pose based on the testing of blood lead levels from local 
populations, blood lead levels are not required for HRS scoring and not used in an HRS evaluation of a site. 
Sufficient relative risk was established by the Site achieving an NPL eligible HRS site score of 51.15 based on the 
HRS scoring of the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and 
subsurface intrusion pathway.  
 
See also section 3.14, Ongoing Investigation and Remediation,  of this support document for information related to 
investigation and remedial efforts at the Site, and section 3.2, Community Involvement, of this support document 
for discussion of comments about public communications.  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 37  This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.16 Regulatory Limits and Screening Levels 
Comment : Several commenters provided comments discussing contamination compared to screening levels and 
regulatory limits.  
 
Water Quality Several commenters stated there were little to no surface water concentrations that exceeded water quality 
standards in the Upper Columbia River. TAI commented that the Upper Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt 
surface water data indicated few metals have been detected at concentrations exceeding generic water quality benchmarks and standards. Stevens County stated  that the water in Upper Columbia River  and Lake Roosevelt 
meets and exceeds drinking water standards, which makes it hard to understand “ why the s cores are so high to 
warrant listing with no human health risk and data backing up this conclusion.” SCBID commented that comprehensive surface water sampling in the Upper Columbia River, including where irrigation water is drawn 
from the river , has yielded results that were all below human health and ecological surface water screening levels. 
Several  citizens commented that the water in Lake Roosevelt meets drinking water standards and with some 
characterizing the situation as “hardly an environmental cata strophe ”; the same commenters  recognized there is 
metals contamination in sediment s, but described it as trapped or buried in river sediments. One additional public 
commenter stated that tests show most of the lake water meets drinking water standards and most fish are edible with no adverse health issues being reported by those who eat the fish.  
 One citizen  commented that  while the EPA indicated that there are locations with slag that can lower water 
quality levels, most people do not use river water for drinking water.  Soil 
TAI commented  that many residential properties that exceed ed the EPA assigned site- specific action l evel of 700 
parts per million (ppm) lead in soil ha ve already been cleaned up. It commented that it is unclear if scoring the 
upland areas alone would be sufficient to support adding this site to the NPL because these residential properties that exceed the site-specific action level have been cleaned up and the area is sparsely populated. Stevens County commented that all residential properties exceeding prev ious guidance on lead levels have been cleaned up, noting 
that lead levels alone do not indicate a need for remedial actions.  
 
Multiple commenters questioned the use and validity of new EPA lead level guidance. TAI asserted  that the 
existence of areas with lead concentrations above the EPA’s new screening levels  is not an appropriate basis for 
adding a site to the NPL. TAI also commented that an action l evel has already been set, a ction has been taken, and 
the RI/FS is currently underway to determine the type and necessity of remedial actions. TAI contended that the 
EPA’s new screening level does not justify listing, as there is no indication that the current action level for the Site is not protective. Stevens County argued that the EPA’s new soil lead screening level guidance is associated 
with questions regarding its validity and there is no science-based connection to blood levels in vulnerable 
populations. Stevens County also commented that blood studies conducted by the local health district show no 
elevated lead levels in children, prior to the new EPA lead guidance. Stevens County noted that the new EPA lead 
guidance, which is not complete yet, will not match the metal levels regulated by the state of Washington. A citizen also claimed that “ EPA changed the levels downward to match the data” because lead levels in the Stevens 
County area were not high enough to support the listing decision.   
Response: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly documented an observed release of metals, 
including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead zinc, and mercury, to the Upper Columba River based on sediment samples and established the presence of lead and arsenic in soil at concentrations meeting 
observed contamination criteria. That releases to the Upper Columbia River and contamination in the soil may be 
below various site, State, or EPA cleanup standards and goals does not eliminate those hazardous substances or Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 38  their releases from consideration when evaluating a site using the HRS.  CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(B) directs the 
EPA to list on the NPL “releases” of hazardous substances, pollutants and contaminants according to specific 
criteria set out in CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(A). The definition of “release” in CERCLA Section 101(22) 
exem pts certain releases from its scope, but it does not exempt releases below regulatory limits (or 
screening/action levels).  
 
The concentrations of hazardous substances evaluated in the HRS documentation record at proposal were eligible 
for consideration consistent with the HRS. On July 16, 1982, when responding to public comments on the 
proposed (original) HRS (47 FR 31188), and again on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40665), the EPA rejected the 
idea that releases within regulatory limits should not be considered “observed releases” under the HRS. As the 
EPA noted in 1982:  
 
[E]mission or effluent limits do not necessarily represent levels which cause no harm to public 
health or the environment. These limitations are frequently established on the basis of economic 
impacts or achievability.  
 
By contrast, an observed release represents a 100 percent likelihood that substances can migrate from the site (47 FR 31188, July 16, 1982). Similarly, observed contamination (the soil exposure counterpart for the HRS observed 
release used in other HRS pat hways) documents that a hazardous substance is present in the surface at 
concentrations significantly above background.  
 Section 2.3 of the revised HRS (55 FR 51589, December 14, 1990) states that an observed release can be 
established either by direct observation or by chemical analysis. An observed release by chemical analysis has 
occurred when a contaminant is measured si gnificantly above background level if some portion of the release is 
attributable to the site; observed contamination is documented when a hazardous substance attributable to the site 
is present at a concentration significantly above background levels for the site within two feet of the surface. 
Although contaminant levels may be lower than regulatory limits, an observed release or observed contamination 
is nevertheless considered to have occurred if the measured levels are significantly higher than backgro und levels. 
The HRS does, however, consider whether releases are above regulatory limits in evaluating target populations, increasing by a factor of 10 the weight assigned populations exposed to contaminants above regulatory limits.  For 
this Site, observed releases by both direct observation and chemical analysis were established for the surface 
water migration pathway at the Site (see pages 55 -76 of the HRS documentation record at proposal). The 
observed release by chemical analysis at this Site was established based on sediment samples collected from the 
river. An area of observed contamination was established, as well as Level I targets , for the soil exposure 
component  of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway (see pages 92 -95 and 108 of the HRS 
documentation record at proposal).  
 
Documentation of an observed release or observed exposure and associated HRS likelihood of release/likelihood 
of exposure factors alone  are not intended to reflect the hazard presented by the particular release. Instead, the 
hazard of a site is approximated by the total HRS score, which incorporates the likelihood of release/likelihood of exposure factors  with other factors such as waste characteristics (including waste quantity, toxicity, ecotoxicity, 
persistence, and bioaccumulation) and targets. This tot al HRS score reflects the hazard of the site relative to the 
other sites that have been scored. A more comprehensive characterization of the contamination, associated releases, and the impacts thereof are fully determined during the RI that typically follo ws listing.   
 Regarding the commenters’ claim that many residential properties that exceed the EPA assigned site- specific 
action level have already been cleaned up, the Site has been appropriately evaluated with respect to the response 
actions  and current conditions. The EPA consider s current conditions, including changes in site conditions due to 
all removal and remedial activities, when it considers what CERCLA action, if any, is warranted at a site on the 
NPL. For example, page 92 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 39  [h]owever, since EPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area 
dating back to 2003 [see Site Summary  section of this HRS documentation record], not all 
properties were included within the AOC polygon; for the purpose of determining the hazardous waste quantity area and resident population for the AOC, a conservative approach was taken and only contaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did not have soil 
removals, were included in the calculation . [emphasis  added]  
 
Related to the comments on the use and validity of the EPA’s new lead level guidance, this lead level guidance is 
not relevant to HRS scoring or NPL listing; see section 3.13, Consistency with Guidance/Use of Guidance, of this support document for more det ails. Additionally, blood lead levels are not required for HRS scoring and are not 
used in an HRS evaluation of a site.   
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.17 Other Non-Listing Activities  
Comment : Several commenters submitted comments discussing activities that are not directly related to placing 
the Site on the NPL. 
 
The EWCOG, SCBID, and EBID expressed concern that the proposed NPL placement of the Site could possibly 
impact the on -going Columbia River Treaty negotiations between the U.S. Government and the Government of 
Canada.   
Stevens County commented that it disagreed with Governor Jay Inslee’s letter of concurrence for the NPL listing of the Site. It asserted that local officials were not consulted or contacted prior to the Governor submitting a letter 
of concurrence. Stevens County requested that the Governor retract the letter of concurrence. Stevens County also 
requested that the Governor discuss the NPL listing with local officials before supporting NPL designation of the 
Site.  
 
Two citizens submitted comments discussing  the dam (Grand Coulee Dam) . One commenter opposed listing 
pointing to the need for the nearby dams for hydroelectric power and for agricultural irrigation purposes and noting that the dams have fish passages. A second citizen submitted similar comments, noting the value of the 
dam for hydroelectric power and irrigation; the commenter stated that if fish are the concern, mitigation of fish 
migration pathways should occur via a fish ladder or other alternatives as opposed to removal of the dam.   
Response: Comments presenting  concerns regarding the on -going Columbia River Treaty negotiations, the 
coordination efforts between the Governor and local officials , and impacts to the Grand Coulee Dam  have been 
noted and are in the public record for the Site. These topics fall outside of the scope of the present listing action; therefore, these comments do not impact the HRS site score or the decision to list the Site on the NPL.  
 
Regarding the Columbia River Treaty negotiations discussed by commenters, these negotiations are handled by 
the State Department and are outside the scope of the listing decision. The State Department is involved with 
these negotiations and provides additional information for interested individuals on its Columbia River Treaty 
webpage ( https://www.state.gov/columbia- river -treaty/ ). 
 Regarding Stevens County’s concerns about the Governor’s concurrence letter  and coordination with local 
officials , the Governor of the s tate of Washington supported NPL designation in his letter expressing concurrence 
with the EPA’s decision to list the Site on the NPL. The letter of concurrence, in part, states “ [o]n behalf of the 
state of Washington, I strongly support the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed listing of the 
Upper Columbia River (UCR) Site on the National Priorities List (NPL).” Additionally, Stevens County’s Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 40  concerns regarding coordination efforts between the Governor and local officials are outside the scope of the 
present NPL listing action.  
 Additionally, the NPL designation of the Site does not determine the fate of the dam  (the Grand Co ulee Dam ). 
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.18 Non-Scoring HRS Documentation Record Comments 
Comment : TAI and the Government of Canada provided comments discussing possible inconsistencies in the 
HRS documentation record at proposal relating to discussion of slag releases and/or the discussion of a fish advisory study.  
 
Regarding slag releases, the Government of Canada requested that revisions be made in the HRS documentation 
record at proposal to clarify that these are historical releases that occurred only up through 1996, with the 
exception of three  accidental releases in 1998. The Government of Canada stated that slag has not been 
discharged from the Cominco  smelter since 1998 and requested that the discussion clarify that current effluent 
does not contain slag. The Government of Canada also requested additional revisions related to slag releases, 
suggesting changes to the following discussions in  the HRS documentation record at proposal: 
 
• The discussion on page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal referring to Cominco’s 
operations as characterized by frequent accidental releases into the river should be clarified as historical.  
• The discussion on page 55 of the HRS documentation record at proposal noting that, “[t]he BC MOE 
required the elimination of slag to the Columbia River by December 1996; however; since this time, 
Cominco has had several releases of slag to the river” should be clarified as historical.  
• The discussion on pages 53 and 55 of the HRS documentation record at proposal described probable point 
of entry ( PPE) 1, associated with the Trail facility, in present tense and PPE2, associated with the Le Roi 
smelter, in past tense, even though the Trail facility halted slag releases to the river in 1996 and thus this 
should be corrected. 
• The discussion on page 77 of the HRS documentation record at proposal that refers to “outfalls that 
discharge effluent and slag” to the river should be clarified as historical.  
• The description of the table on page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal should be revised to 
“‘Table 1 lists hazardous substances present in Cominco outfall effluent in 199[5/6].’” 
 
Regarding the discussion of a Washington State Department of Health (WSDH)  fish advisory (Reference 52 of 
the HRS documentation record at proposal), TAI and the Government of Canada commented that the discussion of the fish advisory on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal appear ed to incorrectly discuss the 
advisory. TAI asserted that the HRS documentation record at proposal misidentified the origin of a statement identifying Teck as the source of metals in the river in stating “ ‘[a] [Washing ton State Department of Health 
(WSDH)]  fish consumption advisory Technical Summary (dated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a 
primary source of metals and other chemical contaminants in the UCR’ ”; instead of the Washington State 
Department of Health, TAI commented that the origin is actually identified in the advisory document as the EPA. 
The Government of Canada questioned the same statement, noting that it appear ed to suggest that Teck is a source 
of fish advisories associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)  and mercury even though smelters and 
atmospheric sources are identified in the report. The Government of Canada noted that the report refers to Teck because the WS DH used data related to Teck from a fish study. The Government of Canada requested that the 
statement on page 84 be revised to clarify the reason for the advisory.   Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 41  Response:  The commenters’ points about possible inconsistencies in the HRS documentation record at proposal 
have been noted and are included as a part of the record for the Site because they were submitted to the docket as 
comments. While the EPA acknowledges the po ints provided by the commenters, the EPA notes that these 
possible inconsistencies do not affect the HRS site score or impact the decision to add the Site to the NPL.  
 
The commenter is correct that the supporting information indicates that slag discharges from Teck were historical, 
and the EPA does  not dispute these as historical  discharges; this is evidenced by the below items from the HRS 
documentation record at proposal . Page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal state d, “[s] lag, 
historically  discharged via smelter outfalls to the Columbia River….” [emphasis added] Further, page 31 stated 
“[t]he B.C. Ministry of Environment, Lands, and Parks required the elimination of slag to the Columbia River by 
December 1996; however, since this time, Cominco has had several releases of slag to the river during upset 
conditions.” Page 55 stated “Cominco operated four outfalls that have historically  discharged slag and effluent 
directly to the Columbia River .” [emphasis added] The statement regarding frequent accidental releases on HRS 
documentation record at proposal page 31 was intended to describe a wider array of spills (only some of which 
include slag), as further detailed on HRS documentation record at proposal pages 55-57. Page 55 provided a 
timeline for the releases and specifically stated that not all of the releases involved hazardous substances:  
 
Cominco’s operations have been characterized by frequent accidental releases of contaminants into the UCR. On 86 occasions between September 1987 and May 2001, Cominco reported 
spills of pollutants into the UCR; although not all would necessarily involve hazardous 
substances …. [emphasis added] 
 
Table 8 of the HRS documentation record list ed historical spills, only some of which mention slag.  
 All of  this information indicates that the HRS documentation record at proposal recognized the releases of slag 
from Cominco were , for the most part , historical.  
 The discussion of PPE1 on page 53 of the HRS documentation record at proposal began  by stating “ Cominco 
operates outfalls that have historically discharged slag and effluent directly to the UCR” [emphasis added] and 
subsequent discussion of PPE1 in the present tense generally involves HRS scoring elements (the HRS probable 
point of entry itself, the HRS in- water segment, the HRS target distance limit). PPEs can be historical in nature, 
and t here are no HRS requirements that PPEs or releases have to be occur ring in the present day to be eligible for 
HRS listing.  
 
Regarding the paragraph concerning the fish advisory on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal , 
the commenter is correct that Teck is not the sole cause of the fish advisory , and the intent of the HRS 
documentation record was not to imply that Teck was the sole cause. T he intent of the associated statements in the 
HRS documentation record at proposal was simply to note that 1) fish advisories are in place that affect the Upper 
Columbia River, 2) the advisories are due to both PCBs ( which is not  associated with the Site) and mercury 
(which is  associated with the Site); and Teck is a significant contributor to contaminants (including contaminants 
in the river).  
 On the origin of identification of the Cominco  smelter as a primary source of metals and other chemical 
contaminants in the Upper Columbia River, the EPA acknowledges that the commenters are correct and clarifies 
that, although the supporting statement is housed in a WSDH document, that document attributes the 
identification to the EPA.  
 
Because these issues do not affect the HRS site score or the decision to list the Site on the NPL, the HRS 
documentation record at proposal itself will not be revised; however , these clarifications are part of the record for 
the Site by virtue of inclusion in this support document.  
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024

3.19 Hazardous Substance Definition 
Comment : TAI commented that slag is not a CERCLA hazardous substance and is not included in 40 CFR part 
302, Table 302.4, List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities. TAI also asserted that the solid waste 
definition in 40 CFR 261.4 excludes slag. TAI stated that the hazardous constituent quantity is based only on the 
mass of CERCLA hazardous substances. TAI asserted that since slag is not a hazardous substance under 
CERLCA, using slag to determine the hazardous waste quantity for Source 1 is incorrect and misleading.  
 
Response: Slag is appropriate to use in determining the hazardous waste quantity for a source in the HRS 
evaluation of a site because it is a source material that contains hazardous substances. Although “slag” is indeed 
not itself a CERCLA hazardous substance, it contains CERCLA hazardous substances eligible for HRS scoring, 
and the hazardous substances within the slag evaluated as part of Source 124 were appropriately associated with 
the source. A material need not be a “solid waste” or “hazardous waste” under the 40 CFR Part 261 list for 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA) to be addressed under CERCLA. 
 HRS Section 1.1, Definitions , defines a hazardous substance for HRS purposes as “CERCLA hazardous 
substances, pollutants, and contaminants as defined in CERCLA Sections 101(14) and 101(33), except where otherwise specifically noted in the HRS.” Additionally:  
• CERCLA Section 101(14) defines “hazardous substance” in the context of other f ederal legislation, 
including substances listed pursuant to Sections 307(a) and 311(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (known as RCRA), and Section 112 of the 
Clean Air Act, and substances that are the subject of an action under Section 7 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. It states that a CERCLA “hazardous substance” is:  
(A) any substance designated pursuant to section 311(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A)], (B) any element, compound, mixture, 
solution, or substance designated pursuant to section 9602 of this title, (C) any hazardous 
waste having the characteristics identified under or listed pursuant to section 3001 of the 
Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6921] (but not including any waste the regulation of which under the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.] has been suspended 
by Act of Congress), (D) any toxic pollutant listed under section 307(a) of the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1317(a)], (E) any hazardous air pollutant listed 
under section 112 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7412], and (F) a ny imminently 
hazardous chemical substance or mixture with respect to which the Administrator has 
taken action pursuant to section 7 of the Toxic Substances Control Act [15 U.S.C. 2606]. 
The term does not include petroleum, including crude oil or any fract ion thereof which is 
not otherwise specifically listed or designated as a hazardous substance under subparagraphs (A) through (F) of this paragraph, and the term does not include natural 
gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usa ble for fuel (or mixtures 
of natural gas and such synthetic gas).”  
Thus, hazardous wastes as defined under RCRA are only a subset of the broader list of CERCLA 
hazardous substances.  
 
24 Page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal referred  to the name of Source 1 as “Cominco Outfalls Slag”; 
however, for HRS scoring purposes, Source 1 does not solely consist of slag and is defined as “effluent from outfalls from a 
lead, silver, and zinc smelter and fertilizer production operation owned by Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada, Ltd.  (Cominco). ” Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 43  • CERCLA Section 102(a) empowers the Administrator to promulgate regulations designating other 
substances as hazardous if when released into the environment they may present substantial danger to the 
public health or welfare or the environment. 
• CERCLA Section 101(33) defines “pollutant or contaminant” as including but not limited to “any 
element, substance, compound, or mixture, including disease -causing agents, which after release into the 
environment and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation, or assimilation into any organism, either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through food chains, will or may reasonably be 
anticipated to cause death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutation, physiological 
malfunctions (including malfunctions in reproduction) or physical deformations, in such organisms or 
their offspring.” Substances meeting that definition may also be addressed under CERCLA. 
 
The list of hazardous substances for CERCLA purposes (pursuant to CERCLA Section 102) is maintained in table 
302.4 of 40 CFR part 302.4.
25 This table also notes the particular federal legislation under which each hazardous 
substance is designated.  
 
HRS Section 2.2.2, Identify hazardous substances associated with a source , gives instruction on associating 
hazardous substances with a source, stating:  
 
For each of the three migration pathways, consider those hazardous substances documented in a source (for example, by sampling, labels, manifests, oral or written statements) to be associated 
with that source when evaluating each pathway. 
 Page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal explained  that hazardous substances are associated with 
Source 1, Cominco Outfalls Slag. Page 33 stated that: 
 
[E]ffluent was not sampled by consultants for EPA. For this reason, hazardous substances listed 
to be present in outfall effluent are documented by Cominco reports and from outfall releases reported to the B.C. Ministry of Environment, Lands, and Parks by Com inco.

Thus a ntimony, arsenic, cadmium , chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc were 
associated with Source 1. These substances are CERCLA hazardous substances based on their specific 
listing in the list of CERCLA hazardous substances. The 40 CFR Table 302.4 list of CERCLA hazardous substances includes antimony, arsenic, cadmium , chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and 
zinc, and shows that each of these particular substances qualifies  as a CERCLA hazardous substance via 
being listed as a t oxic pollutant under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and/or a hazardous air 
pollutant under the Clean Air Act (i.e., via CERCLA 101(14) subparts (D) and (E), respectively). These substances therefore qualify as CERCLA hazardous substances, meet the HRS definition of hazardous substance, and are eligible for HRS scoring. 
 
In addition, the fact that slag 
 as a material does not qualify as a RCRA hazardous waste does not negate 
the CERCLA hazardous substance status of the metals in that slag. As noted above, the CERCLA 
definition of hazardous substances includes those substances listed as RCRA hazardous was tes as a subset  
of substances that qualify as CERCLA hazardous substances, along with substances listed under the other statutes. Exclusion of a material under one of these statutes does not invalidate the inclusion of the same or related material on one of the other statute’s lists. The courts have understood that RCRA hazardous 
wastes are only one subset of the broader list of CERCLA hazardous substances. See, e.g., Louisiana-
Pacific Corp. v. ASARCO, Inc., 24 F.3d 1565, 1572-1573 (9th Cir. 1994); Eagle-Picher v. EPA, 759 F.2d 
922, 926-931 (D.C. Cir. 1985).
26 Thus, the metals in the slag were properly scored based on their 
eligibility as CERCLA hazardous substances consistent with the HRS definition of a hazardous 
substance. 
 
Finally, as further explained in section 3.20, Source 1 Hazardous Waste Quantity, of this support 
do
cument, the hazardous constituent quantity was not scored for Source 1. The hazardous wastestream 
quantity was used to determine the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity value and involves a measure of 
the mass of source material  that contains CERCLA hazardous substances. 
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.20 Source 1 Hazardous Waste Quantity  
Comment : TAI commented that the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity was not appropriately estimated. TAI 
stated that the HRS documentation record at proposal incorrectly used a release of 4,313,132 cubic yards of slag 
to assign a maximum hazardous waste quantity value from HRS Table 2- 6. TAI commented that the HRS uses the 
 
26 The Eagle Picher  court opinion included that “based upon the clear language of section 101(14), we conclude that the 
exception set forth in section 101(14)(C) does not prevent a substance from being labelled a ‘ hazardous substance ’ if it falls 
within another subparagraph of section 101(14).”  Eagle -Picher v. EPA , 759 F.2d 922, 930  (D.C. Cir. 1985).  The Louisiana -
Pacific Corp. opinion discussed that slag in that case included metals like arsenic, copper, lead, and zinc and that these are 
hazardous substances under CERCLA 101(14) subsections (A), (B), and (D), and noted that “[t] he fact that slag is excepted 
from subsection (C) by the Bevill Amendment has no bearing on whether slag in its component forms is excepted from the 
other subsections. ” Louisiana- Pacific Corp. v. ASARCO, Inc., 24 F.3d 1565, 1572- 1573 (9th Cir. 1994) . Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 45  mass of CERCLA hazardous substances to determine the hazardous constituent quantity. TAI also stated that slag 
is not a CERCLA hazardous substance and excluded from the definition of solid waste under 40 CFR 261.4. TAI 
concluded that the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity value was incorrectly estimated based on a volume of slag, 
which is not a CERCLA hazardous substance.  
 
Response: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly assigned a hazardous waste quantity value for 
Source 1 based on an evaluation of Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity. The HRS documentation record at proposal did not evaluate Tier A, hazardous constituent quantity, for Source 1 as implied by the commenter. 
 
H
RS Section 1.1, Definitions , defines a hazardous wastestream as “[m] aterial containing  CERCLA hazardous 
substances (as defined in CERCLA section 101[14]) that was deposited, stored, disposed, or placed in, or that otherwise migrated to, a source .” 
 In providing instructions for the source hazardous waste quantity evaluation, HRS Section 2.4.2.1.2, Hazardous 
wastestream quantity , states:  
 
Evaluate hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) based on the mass of hazardous wastestreams plus the mass of any 
additional C ERCLA pollutants and contaminants (as defined in CERCLA section 101[33], as 
amended) that are allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure). For a wastestream that consists solely of a hazardous waste listed pursuant to section 3001 of RCRA, as amended or that consists solely of a RC RA hazardous waste that exhibits the 
characteristics identified under section 3001 of RC RA, as amended, include the mass of that 
entire hazardous waste in the evaluation of this measure.   
Based on this mass, designated as W, assign a value for hazardous wastestream quantity as 
follows: 
• For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for hazardous wastestream quantity using the Tier B equation of Table 2–5…. 
Do not evaluate the volume and area measures described below if the source is the unallocated source or if the following condition applies: 
• The hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or 
area of observed exposure) is adequately determined–that is, total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from 
the source (or for the area of observed contamination) is known or is estimated with 
reasonable confidence…. 
Otherwise, assign the source (or area of observed contamination) a value for hazardous 
wastestream quantity based on the available data and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.3. 
 
HRS Section 2.4.2.1.5, Calculation of source hazardous waste quantity value , states:  
 
Select the highest of the values assigned to the source (or areas of observed contamination, areas 
of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination) for the hazardous constituent 
quantity, hazardous wastestream quantity, volume, and area measures. 
 Page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal identified the hazardous substances associated with Source 1. As explained in section 3.19, Hazardous Substance Definition, of this support document, page 33 of the HRS 
documentation record at proposal include d Tables 1 and 2 , which identify that a ntimony, arsenic, cadmium , 
chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc were associated with Source 1.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 46  As part of the discussion of the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity evaluation, page 34 of the HRS documentation 
record at proposal stated that:  
 
Therefore, there is insufficient information to evaluate the associated releases from the source to calculate the hazardous constituent quantity for Source 1 with reasonable confidence. As a result, 
the evaluation of hazardous waste quantity proceeds to the evaluation of Tier B , Hazardous 
Wastestream Quantity . 
 
In discussing the scoring of Tier B, Hazardous Wastestream Quantity, pages 34 and 38 state d: 
 
Reports that accurately document the yearly and daily amounts of tail slag released to the UCR from the Cominco smelter have not been located. Reports prepared by consultants to Cominco 
state that prior to 1995, slag was discharged to the UCR at an average yearly rate of 145,000 
tonnes or 159,836 tons (i.e., 145,000 tonnes / 0.90718 tonnes per 1 ton = 159,836 tons) and an 
average daily rate of 360 tonnes or 397 tons (i.e., 360 tonnes / 0.90718 tonnes per 1 ton = 397 
tons) [Ref. 13, p. 37; Ref. 53, p. 2]. The quantity of slag produced for each year of smelter operation can more accurately be calculated from lead production values. Cominco has reported 
that the amount of lead is directly related to the amount of slag produced using the following 
information [R ef. 15, p. 2].  
 
Lead production x 140% = amount of blast furnace slag produced.  Amount of blast furnace slag produced x 85% = Amount of slag produced. For example:  
 
- 151,492 tons of lead produced in 1930 x 140% = 212,088.8 tons of blast furnace slag 
- 212,088.8 tons of blast furnace slag x 85% = 180,275.48 tons of slag produced in 1930 
 
Lead production values were obtained from Cominco annual reports [Ref. 3, pp. 3- 20]. Using this 
information, it is estimated that 11,980,922.52 tons or 23,961,845,040 pounds (11,980,922.52 x 2,000 pounds per 1 ton) of tail slag were produced from the Cominco smelter and released to the 
UCR over the course of operations from 1930 to 1994 as demonstrated in Table 3 below…  
Based on the report conducted by a consultant for CCT, it is estimated that 90 percent of the slag discharged to the UCR (between 1930 and 1994) was transported into the U.S. [Ref. 18, p. 5, 87, 
89, 90]. The value assigned to hazardous wastestream quantity is calculated as follows:  
 
23,961,845,040 pounds x 0.9 = 21,565,660,536 pounds  21,565,660,536 pounds / 5,000 = 4,313,132.10  
Hazardous Wastestream Quantity (W) Value: 4,313,132.10  
[Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.2, Table 2-5] 
 Page 39 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed the source hazardous waste quantity value for 
Source 1 and stated , “[t] he source hazardous waste quantity value for Source 1 is 4,313,132.10 for Tier B – 
Hazardous Wastestream Quantity .” 
 In calculating the hazardous waste quantity for Source 1, the hazardous wastestream quantity was evaluated and 
not the hazardous constituent quantity as implied by the commenter. Page 34 of the HRS documentation record at 
proposal, quoted above, explained  that because insufficient information was available to calculate Tier A, 
hazardous constituent quantity, the next tier, Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity , was evaluated instead.  
 
As described in HRS Section 2.4.2.1.1, Hazardous constituent quantity , t
 he hazardous constituent quantity is the 
HRS measure that involves just the mass of hazardous substances (i.e., it is “based solely on the mass of CERCLA  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 47  hazardous substances (as defined in CERCLA  section 101(14)” with some exceptions for certain RCRA wastes). 
By contrast, for HRS purposes, a hazardous wastestream  is defined as material that contains hazardous substances, 
and the mass of that wastestream is the subject of this hazardous waste quantity measure. (See HRS Section 
2.4.2.1.2, quoted above.) Slag is material containing hazardous substances that are eligible for HRS scoring, as explained in section 3.19, Hazardous Substance Definition, of this support document. Therefore, slag that has been 
released from an outfall is consistent with the HRS definition of a hazardous wastestream.  
 A
s these comments relate to the evaluation of the hazardous waste quantity, Tier B, the hazardous wastestream 
quantity, was properly determined consistent with the HRS requirements. HRS Section 2.4.2.1.2 directs to 
calculate the mass of hazardous wastestreams and to assign a value for the hazardous wastestream quantity 
regardless of whether it is completely or partially estimated. Using the available data for the mass of slag released (i.e., an HRS- eligible hazardous wastestream), a partial estimate of the mass of the wastestream from the outfall 
(i.e., the slag) was calculated as 21,565,660,536 pounds. In this case, only the slag discharged to the river and transported to the U.S. part of the river was scored. As quoted above, after applying the divisor in HRS Table 2-5, 
a value of 4,313,132.10 was assigned as a partial estimate of the hazardous wastestream quantity. As directed in 
HRS Section 2.4.2.1.2, because the “total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from the source” is not known or “estimated with reasonable confidence,” 
the evaluation proceeded to Tier C, Volume, in accordance with the HRS.  
 Furthermore, although the HRS documentation record at proposal assigned the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity 
value based on a partial Tier B (hazardous wastestream quantity) estimate, the Tier C (volume) estimate received the same value. As discussed on page 38 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, the HRS documentation 
record at proposal also evaluated Tier C, Volume, based on the volume of the slag discharged and carried to the 
U.S. part of the river , which received the same estimated value of 4,313,132.10. 
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  
3.21 Surface Water Migration Pathway 
Comment : TAI and three citizens submitted comments questioning aspects of the scoring of the surface water 
migration pathway.  
 
Response: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly scored the surface water migration pathway 
consistent with the HRS. Specific comments and responses are provided below in the following subsections:  
 
• 3.21.1 C
ontainment  
• 3.21.2 Attribution 
• 3.21.3 Waste Characteristics 
• 3.21.4 Human Food Chain Threat – Targets 
 
3.21.1  Containment  
Comment: TAI and three citizens submitted comments related to containment of contamination. TAI asserted that 
metals are releasing from slag at slow rates as indicated by the few metals detected at concentrations above 
benchmarks. Two citizens commented that the metal contamination in the Upper Columbia River is buried 
beneath sediment. A citizen stated that metals are covered by sediment as indicated by the lack of contamination 
in bottom feeding fish.  
 
Response :  Insomuch as these comments pertain to whether the contamination scored is contained, Sources 1, 2, 
and 3 were determined to be uncontained for HRS scoring purposes. F or HRS scoring purposes, the containment Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 48  of contamination is generally measured at the source and is an evaluation of how well contained hazardous 
substance- bearing source material is from escaping into the environment.  
 In providing source containment instructions in the surface water migration pathway section, HRS Section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1, Containment , states:  
 
Determine the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:  
• If one or more sources is located in surface water in the watershed (for example, intact sealed drums in surface water), assign the containment factor a value of 10 for the  
watershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1. 
• If none of the sources is located in surface water in the watershed, assign a containment factor value from table 4 –2 to each source at the site that can potentially release 
hazardous substances to the hazardous substance migration path for this watershed. 
Assign the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:  
- Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources that meet the 
minimum size requirement described below. Assign this highest value as the 
containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1. 
- If, for this watershed, no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then 
select the highest containment factor value assigned to the sources at the site eligible 
to be evaluated for this watershed and assign it as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1.  
A source meets the minimum size requirement if its source hazardous waste quantity value (see 
section 2.4.2.1.5) is 0.5 or more. Do not include the minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this surface water migration component, except po tential to release by flood as 
specified in section 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.

In discussing Source 1, page 32 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  
 
Containment 
 Release to surface water via overland migration:  
The source consists of outfalls that discharged effluent and slag directly to the Columbia River 
[Ref. 4, p. 26]. A surface water containment value of 10 is assigned based on evidence of 
hazardous substance migration from the source to the UCR [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. 
 
Release to surface water via flood:  
 The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it 
does not affect the listing decision. 
 
In discussing Source 2, page 40 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  
 
Containment 
 Release to surface water via overland migration: The source consists of exposed contaminated 
soil which does not have a maintained engineered cover or a functioning and maintained run-on 
control system and runoff management system [Refs. 5, p. 791-792; 38, pp. 68-69, 94; 57, p. 2]. A surface water containment factor value of 10 is assigned [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. 
 Release to surface water via flood:  
 The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it does not affect the listing decision. 
 In discussing Source 3, pages 46 -47 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated :  
 
Containment  
 
Release to surface water via overland migration: The source consists of sluice boxes which 
discharged slag directly to the UCR. This source does not have a maintained engineered cover or 
a functioning and maintained run-on control system and runoff management system [Refs. 4, pp. 
22-24; 5, pp. 780-782; 46, pp. 9-10]. During RI activities conducted by a contractor of the 
Washington State Department of Ecology in 2019, slag was observed in 101 of 138 samples 
sampled along the UCR waterfront. Most of the obser ved slag was either granular or mixed Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 50  granular and clinker [Ref. 37, pp. 10, 36-38]. Based on this information and the direct discharge 
to the UCR (evidence of hazardous substance migration from the source to the UCR), a surface 
water containment factor value of 10 is assigned [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. 
 
Release to surface water via flood:  
 The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it 
does not affect the listing decision. 
 
Source 1 (Cominco outfalls slag), Source 2 (contaminated soil), and Source 3 (Le Roi sluice boxes discharge) 
were assigned containment factor values of 10 because of evidence of hazardous substance migration and/or a 
lack of containment features  as quoted above. As indicated in the HRS, quoted above, hazardous substances 
associated with a source with a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 are considered available to the watershed and included in the Site score because these sourc es are not fully contained. As all three sources 
were assigned containment factor values of 10 based on source-specific conditions, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly established that each source is uncontained and the associated contamination, including the Cominco outfalls slag (Source 1) and the Le Roi sluice boxes discharge (Source 3), is available to 
the watershed and the surface water migration pathway. For source material that has already migrated into a 
pathway medium— i.e., slag in surface water  sediments for the Site— the HRS scoring factors for the surface 
water migration pathway do not consider such characteristics as the rate of hazardous substance leaching from source materials in sediments into the aqueous phase of the water body or sediment cover of the contaminants.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.21.2  Attribution  
Comment: TAI submitted comments discussing other possible contributors to the contamination scored. TAI 
asserted that the Other Possible Sources Not Scored section of the HRS documentation record at proposal is 
incomplete because it does not discuss other possible origins of contamination.  
 
Response: The Other Possible Sources Not Scored section of the HRS documentation record wa s intended to 
provide discussion of other possible sources associated  with the site being scored (i.e., releases from Cominco 
smelter and Le Roi smelter) , as opposed to other non- site-related  sources. Insomuch as these comments relate to 
the consideration of other possible non- site-related contributors of contamination (contributors other than the 
releases from Cominco smelter and Le Roi smelter) in determining appropr iate attribution of the releases scored, 
such contributors were discussed in the Attribution section of the HRS documentation record at proposal, and 
attribution of the significant increase of hazardous substances to the Site, at l east in part, was properly 
documented for the purpose of scoring an observed release by chemical analysis to surface water.  
 In presenting the requirements for an observed release by chemical analysis, HRS Section 4.1.2.1.1, Observed 
Release, states, in relevant part:  
 
Establish an observed release to surface water for a watershed by demonstrating that the site has 
released a hazardous substance to the surface water in the watershed. Base this demonstration on 
either:  
• Direct observation .… 
• Chemical analysis:  
- Analysis of surface water, benthi c, or sediment samples indicates that the 
concentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the 
background concentration for the site for that type of sample (see section 2.3)…. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 51  • Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to 
establish the observed release, except: when the site itself consists of contaminated sediments with no identified source, no separate attribution is required. [emphasis 
added] 
 
In describing other possibles sources associated with the Upper Columbia River site (i.e., related to the Cominco 
smelter and Le Roi smelter) that were not scored as sources, page 52 of the HRS documentation record at 
proposal state d:  
 
Other Possible Sources Not Scored  
 
Cominco Smelter – Fertilizer Outfall Effluent Discharge  - Fertilizer plants were built at the Trail 
smelter in 1930, facilitating the production of both nitrogen- and phosphorous- based fertilizers. 
One of the five outfalls associated with the Cominco smelter (i.e., Sewer IV) was used for the fertilizer operati on, which discharged effluent to the UCR. A trend graph of metals in effluents 
from the metallurgical operation from 1980 to 1996 demonstrates that fertilizer plant operation contributed to an average effluent discharge up to 4 kg/d of total mercury and 350 kg/d of dissolved zinc [Refs. 4, pp. 25, 26; 9, pp. 6, 24; 12, p. 18]. The outfall discharge associated with 
the fertilizer operation was not scored in this HRS documentation record because the current 
surface water m igration pathway score has a maximum pathway score of 100.  
 This section wa s not intended to address non- site sources unrelated to the Cominco smelter and Le Roi smelter. 
Instead , the HRS documentation record at proposal described the rationale used to assess attribution for the 
observed release in the surface water migration pathway on pages 77 -81. Th is Attribution section  include s on 
pages 78-81 a subsection , Other  Possible Sites, w hich discusses possible contributions of other sources not related 
to the Site. The Attribution section states:  
 
Attribution  
 Analytical results from sediment samples collected in September and October 2019 by 
consultants of Teck as part of a Phase 3 sediment study document an observed release by 
chemical analysis to the UCR. The UCR is contaminated with heavy metals from the U.S . Canada 
border to RM 708 near Marcus, Washington, an approximate 35- mile stretch of river [see Section 
4.1.2.1.1 of this HRS documentation record]. Although sediment samples were collected from three areas of concern which are several miles apart, contami nation does exist between these 
areas. A Phase 2 Sediment study was previously conducted by a consultant of Teck and when this sediment data is combined with the Phase 3 data, the 35 -mile stretch encompassing the zone of 
contamination exhibits nearly conti nuous contamination [Ref. 66, pp. 3-162]. Sources associated 
with each smelter included in this HRS documentation record [see Section 2.2 of this HRS 
documentation record] have contributed to commingling of metals contamination in the UCR [see 
Section 4.1.2.1.1 of this HRS documentation record] and impact the targets on the UCR including 
fisheries, wetlands, and a Federal- designated threatened species habitat [Sections 4.1.3.3.1, 
4.1.3.3.2.2, and 4.1.4.3.1.2 of this HRS documentation record].  
 Previous sediment investigations within the UCR have also documented contamination to the 
UCR from sources associated with both smelters. In 2001, consultants for EPA conducted an 
expanded site inspection (ESI) of the UCR.... Analytical results from this investigation indicated 
widespread contamination in lake and river sediments throughout the UCR between Inchelium, 
Washington and the U.S.- Canada border. Arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc 
were detected at conc entrations significantly above background sample concentrations, which 
were collected from Lower Arrow Lake by the Washington State Department of Ecology [Ref. 4, pp. 66, 71-85]. During this investigation, several sediment samples collected from the UCR Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 52  consisted of a visibly dark glassy sandy mixture characterized by EPA field personnel as slag 
[Ref. 4, p. 93]. The ESI sampling program also included the collection of sediment samples from 
the mouths of 110 tributaries located along the UCR to determine other potential sources of 
contamination. Analytical results from tributary samples did not indicate the presence of elevated 
contaminants of interest indicative of major watershed sources of contamination [Refs. 4, pp. 
165-217, 226- 227; 17, pp. 62- 63]. 
 Source 1 (i.e., Cominco Outfalls Slag) is located approximately 10 RMs upstream of the U.S.-
Canada border and was scored based on an observed release by direct observation from outfalls 
that discharge effluent  and slag contaminated with metals directly to the UCR [see Source 1 
discussion Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation record]. Although the most upstream scored 
observed release sample is located at Deadman’s Eddy, approximately 17 RMs downstream of 
the Cominco outfalls, contamination of the UCR does exist between the Cominco facility and the 
most upstream scored observed release sample located in Deadman’s Eddy… In 2010, a 
consultant for CCT collected sediment samples from the UCR at locations both upstream and 
downstream of the Cominco outfalls. Analytical results of sediment samples collected during this investigation indicates that concentrations of these metals increased markedly downstream 
(compared to sediment samples collected upstream) of the Cominco smelter and remained at 
elevated levels at four U.S. sampling sites across the U.S. border; the most downstream sample being collected upstream of the Le Roi smelter. Background sediment samples were collected 
upstream of the Cominco smelter in Genelle and just downstream of the Keenleyside Dam [Ref. 
18, pp. 58, 72, 74]. In addition, analytical results of a slag sample collected near the Cominco 
smelter indicated the presence of metals including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, 
copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and mercury [see Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 
18, pp. 36, 58, 63, 74].  
 
From the Cominco smelter outfalls, metals contamination extends downstream along the UCR 
where it comingles with releases associated with the Le Roi smelter. In 1897, the Le Roi smelter 
began refining copper, lead, and silver ores from mines in northeast W ashington, as well as 
copper ore from British Columbia, Canada [Ref. 5, p, 104] …. The smelter was closed and 
dismantled in 1922, after 24 years of sporadic operation [Ref. 5, p. 105]. During its operation, 
slag was discharged from the furnaces at the Le Ro i smelter directly into the UCR via 
underground waterways, also referred to as sluice boxes (i.e., Source 3) …. Facility maps from 
1901 and 1908 depict five underground waterways (sluice boxes, grouped as three passage areas) 
transporting slag from furnaces to discharge points on the UCR [Refs. 4, p. 24; 46, pp. 9- 10].  
 
In 2019, an RI of the Northport Waterfront was conducted by a consultant of the Washington 
State Department of Ecology …. During this investigation, slag materials, (as both clinker and 
fine granulated particles) were noted to be widespread on the beach, the hillside leading to the UCR as well as in the UCR [Ref. 37, pp. 6, 7, 36- 38]…. 
 
The presence of slag along the shores of the UCR has been documented from Trail B.C., the 
location of the Cominco smelter, to RM 708 in Washington State indicating Cominco and Le Roi 
smelters as the sources for this contamination [see Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation 
record].  
 
Metals associated with Cominco smelter and the Le Roi smelter sources were detected at 
concentrations significantly above those concentrations detected in background sediment 
samples; therefore, at least some portion of the significant increase of these me tals in observed 
release samples in the UCR is attributable to a release from sources associated with both smelters [Table 11; Table 13 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 1, Section 4.1.2.1.1].  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 53  Other Possible Sites  
 
In addition to contamination from sources (associated with the two smelters) scored in this 
HRS evaluation, other potential sources of hazardous substances that may have contributed to contamination include mining and milling operations and pulp and paper production [see 
Figures 2 -1 and 5 of this HRS documentation record]. These contaminant sources are 
summarized in the following paragraphs. [emphasis added ] 
 
Celgar Pulp Mill - The Celgar Pulp Company (Celgar ) bleach kraft pulp mill is an additional 
source of hazardous substance contamination to the Columbia River, however, it is not included 
as a source in this HRS documentation record since this document has been limited to sources of 
inorganic contamination and the Celgar mill is instead a source of dioxin/furan contamination. 
The Celgar mill is in Castlegar, B.C., approximately 30 RMs upstream from the U.S.- Canada 
border [ Figure 2 -1 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 22, p. 20]. From 1961 until mid-1993, 
the mill primarily used chlorine in its bleaching process [Ref. 4, p. 31]. The pulp mill discharged 
effluent containing chlorinated organic compounds, including dioxins and furans, into the Columbia River [Ref. 4, p. 31]. 
 
Bonanza Mill  - The Bonanza Mill is located approximately 3 miles northwest of Colville, 
Washington, on the Colville River, a tributary of the Columbia River. The site is a former lead and zinc mill that operated from 1885 to 1952 [Ref. 7, p. 8, 9]. The facility contained a 100-ton flotation mill that processed ore using amalgamation, leaching, and/or flocculation, each of which 
utilized inorganic elements including mercury [Ref. 7, p. 8]. As a result of milling activities, 
approximately 17,500 cubic yards o f tailings and waste rock were spread across the facility [Ref. 
7, p. 11]. Analytical results of tailings/waste rock samples indicate the presence of significant concentrations of arsenic, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 7, pp. 30-31 (Table 6-1)]. Further, analytical results of sediment samples collected 
from the Colville River indicate the presence of lead at an elevated concentration and analytical 
results of sediment samples collected from on -site ditches draining to the Colville River indicate 
the presence of elevated concentrations of arsenic, barium, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 7, pp. 19, 89, 91- 92, 94, and 95]. After these sampling efforts, consultants 
for the EPA conducted a removal action at the facility which included placing 12 to 18 inches of 
either rock or clay barrier over exposed contaminated mine wastes [Ref. 47, pp. 3, 4]. The 
Bonanza Mill is not believed to be a source of the zone of contamination as scored in thi s HRS 
documentation record, as the Colville River discharges to the UCR downstream of the zone of contamination [Ref. 7, pp. 34, 36]. 
 
Young America Mine/Mill  – The Young America Mine is located approximately 3.6 miles 
northwest of Evans and is accessible from Highway 25 via Hutson Jones Way [Ref. 59, p. 5]…. 
The mine portion is located on the eastern side of Highway 25 and is located on land managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The mill and tailings impoundment portion of the 
site is located on four privately -owned parcels west of Highway 25 near the UCR. The mine 
operated between 1897 and 1953, mining zinc, lead, silver, and gold. The flotation mill was built 
(by Gregor Mines, Inc.) in the late 1940s and operated from 1948 to 1954. Tailings resulting from 
the mining operations were discharged downhill towards the west into an impoundment area 
located in the mill portion of  the site …. Laboratory analyses from soil samples collected from the 
mine and mill portions of the site indicated the presence of lead, arsenic, cadmium, and manganese above EPA Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) [Ref. 59, p. 9]. In 2012, EPA conducted a TCR A to consolidate and cap contaminated soil and tailings in the area around and 
below the mill buildings. Mill buildings were crushed in place, the existing cap was removed on the impoundment and the tailings and contaminated soil were capped with a liner and local 
material. The TCRA was completed on November 3, 2012 [Refs. 60, p. 2; 61, p. 2]. In the 2021 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 54  HHRA conducted by EPA, it was determined that there was no evidence that contamination 
moved down-river from the Young America Mine mill impoundment [Ref. 17, p. 62].  
 
Hahnlen Property – The Hahnlen Property is located approximately 3.6 miles northeast of Evans, 
WA on the east side of Highway 25. The UCR shoreline is located approximately 800 feet west of the property…. Approximately 31,568 square feet of lead- contaminated soil was covered with 
a liner; clean soil from a nearby source was placed on the liner Ref. 58, p. 14].  
 
Mines and Mills – Stevens County, Washington  
 In 2001, EPA conducted PA/SI investigations at 39 mines and mills in Stevens County, 
Washington. In addition to the Le Roi smelter, four sites were recommended for further action 
under CERCLA; an additional site (Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill) was later recommended for further 
action under CERCLA [Ref. 30, p. 1]. These sites are summarized below: 
 
Anderson Calhoun Mine/Mill  
 The Anderson Calhoun Mine/Mill is located 1 mile north of Leadpoint, Washington, on the west 
side of Deep Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River [5, pp. 136- 137]. The mine/mill is a former 
lead and zinc mine/mill that is reported to have been in operation from 1948 to 1952 [Ref. 5, p. 136]. The mine/mill contains a tailings pile measuring 555 feet by 500 feet by an unknown depth, a waste rock pile measuring 120 feet by 80 feet by 20 feet deep, an evaporation pond measuring 
105 feet by 50 feet, and a mine pit measuring 100 feet by 50 feet [Ref. 5, pp. 6-136, 139]. 
Analytical results documented significant concentrations of copper and mercury in the tailings 
pile. Lead and zinc were detected in water from the mine pit [Ref. 5, p. 140]. EPA removal action 
activities occurred at the site in 2010 [Ref. 17, p. 68]. The Anderson Calhoun Mine/Mill is not 
believed to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample 
(TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not 
exhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215- 216, 227, 451].  
 
Last Chance Mine/Mill  
 
The Last Chance Mine/Mill is located approximately 5 miles southeast of Northport, Washington, 
near Deep Creek, a tributary of the UCR. The facility is a former lead, silver, and zinc mine/mill 
that produced 5,937,708 pounds of lead; 18,567 pounds of silver and 110,110 pounds of zinc 
between 1904-1954 [Ref. 5, pp. 30, 114] …. Analytical results of waste rock samples indicate the 
presence of significant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, thallium, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 
175 (Table 6-13), 176, 235 (Figur e 6-24)]. A tailings pile is also present at the facility [Ref. 5, p. 
115]…. Analytical results of tailings samples indicate the presence of significant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, p. 175 (Table 6-13), 176, 235 (Figure 6-24)]. 
Further, an unnamed intermittent creek passes through one of the waste rock piles and the tailings pile as it flows toward Deep Creek [Ref. 5, p. 235 (Figure 6- 24)]. The Last Chance Mine/Mill is 
not believed to be a source of contamination to the UCR, a s analytical results from a tributary 
sample (TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not exhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215-216, 227, 451]. 
 
L-Bar/Northwest Magnesite 
 L-Bar/Northwest Magnesite facility is located approximately two miles south of Chewelah, 
Washington, on the south bank of the Colville River, a tributary of the UCR. The facility is a 
former magnesite plant that opened in 1916 and closed in 1968. In the mid-1970s, the facility was 
converted to recover magnesium from a magnesium processing byproduct commonly referred to Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 55  as flux bar. The magnesium recovery facility was closed in 1991 [Ref. 5, p. 78]. It has been 
demonstrated that flux bar and flux bar residue materials are sources of ammonia and chloride 
[Ref. 5, p.79]…. The L -Bar/Northwest Magnesite site is not believed to be a source of the zone of 
contamination as scored in this HRS documentation record, as the Colville River discharges to 
the UCR downstream of the zone of contamination [Ref. 5,pp. 258, 299]. 
 
Van Stone Mine/Mill  
 
The Van Stone Mine/Mill is located approximately 11 miles south of Northport, Washington, on Onion Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River. The facility is a former cadmium, lead, and zinc 
mine/mill that contains two tailings piles, a waste rock storage area, an open pit, a seepage pond, 
and stained soil areas [Ref. 5, pp. 94, 96]; Tailings from ore processing were slurried via a 
wooden flume to pile locations [Ref. 5, p. 95].… Analytical results of tailings samples indicate 
the presence of significant con centrations of lead, manganese, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 160-
165 (Table 6- 6), 166]. Analytical results of waste rock samples indicate the presence of 
significant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 158-160 (Table 6- 6), 
166]. Several unnamed creeks flow through the facility grounds to Onion Creek [Ref. 5, pp. 221 
(Figure 6 -13), 223 (Figure 6-14), and 262]. Surface water runoff from the tailings piles and the 
waste rock area drains to these unnamed creeks [Ref. 5, pp. 221 (Fi gure 6 -13), 262, 223 (Figure 
6-14)]. Analytical results of a sediment sample collected at the probable point of entry from one 
of the tailings piles to an adjacent unnamed creek indicate the presence of elevated concentrations of lead and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 167 (Table 6-7), 168 and 223 (Figure 6-14)]. The Van Stone 
Mine/Mill underwent a removal action in 2017 [Ref. 17, p. 68].  The Van Stone Mine/Mill is not 
believed to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample 
(TS099) collected from Onion Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not 
exhibit significant concentrati ons of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 213- 214, 227, 450].  
 
Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill  
 
The Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill is located approximately 17 miles south of Northport, Washington, on 
the west side of Deep Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River. The mine/mill is a former gold, lead, silver, and zinc mine/mill that operated sporadically from 1909 to 1952 [Ref. 5, pp. 30, 
124]. The mine/mill contains a tailings pile measuring 1,000 feet by 2,100 feet by approximately 20 feet deep and a waste rock pile measuring 100 feet by 50 feet by 5 feet deep [Ref. 5, pp. 124-
125]. Analytical results document significant concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, 
and zinc in both the tailings pile and the waste rock pile [Ref. 5, p. 126]. The Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill underwent removal actions in 2001 and 2002 [Ref. 17, pp. 67-68]. The Sierra Zinc 
Mine/Mill underwent a removal action in 2017 [Ref. 17, p. 68]. The Van Stone Mine/Mill is not 
believed to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample 
(TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not 
exhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215- 216, 227, 451].  
 
Mines and Mills – Pend Oreille County, Washington  
 
In 2001-2002, EPA conducted PA/SI investigations at 21 mines and mills in Pend Oreille County, 
Washington. During this investigation, a total of five sites were recommended for further action 
under CERCLA. Three of the sites have since had their status changed to no further remedial 
action planned (NFRAP) [Ref. 31, p. 1]. The remaining sites are summarized below:

 56  The Josephine Mine is a former zinc, lead, silver, and cadmium mine located in the Metaline 
mining district. The mine area consisted of a shaft, a waste rock pile, a small building, and 
collapsing wood structure. The mine is located directly across the Pend Oreille River from the 
Pend Oreille Mine/Mill. Analytical results of a sediment sample at the probable point of entry of a waste rock pile to the Pend Oreille River documented significant concentrations of cadmium, 
lead, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 6, pp. 50-53, 133]. The Josephine Mine underwent a removal 
action; the site was deemed to have localized contaminant concentrations that met EPA requirements for a removal action; however, the Josephine Mine was not identified as a source of 
contamination to the UCR site [Ref. 17, p. 62].   
Grandview Mine/Mill  
 
The Grandview Mine/Mill is located in the lower Pend Oreille River Valley, approximately 0.75 
mile from the east bank of the Pend Oreille River, approximately 2 miles northeast of Metaline 
Falls, Washington. Source areas identified on site included a taili ngs pile, waste rock piles, and an 
abandoned container and drum area. Analytical results from sampling events conducted in 2000 
and 2001 indicated that the Grandview Mine/Mill is a source of hazardous substance 
contamination to groundwater drinking water wells, an unnamed spring, a former wastewater 
ditch, and the Pend Oreille River. Contaminants detected at elevated concentrations in a sediment 
sample collected from the Pend Oreille River included cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc [Ref. 6, 
pp. 52-53, 134-135]. The Grandview Mine/Mill underwent a removal action; the site was deemed 
to have localized contaminant concentrations that met EPA requirements for a removal action; 
however, the Grandview Mine/Mill was not identified as a source of contamination to the UCR 
site [Ref. 17, p. 62]. 
 
Thus, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly established that the observed release by chemical analysis to surface water was attributable, at least in part, to the Site, and included discussion of other non- site-
related possible contributors to the contamination. ( The significant increase in hazardous substances compared to 
the background level was not challenged by the commenter.) The 11 other possible sites that were identified 
during the HRS evaluation were used to help determine that the observed release was attributable, at least in part, 
to the site as discussed in the Attribution section on pages 77-81 of the HRS documentation record at proposal 
quoted above.  
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 3.21.3  Waste Characteristics  
Comment : TAI stated that the w aste c haracteristics f actor category value, in conjunction with the hazardous waste 
quantity and t oxicity/persistence /bioaccumulation  factor values, was used to determine a maximum human food 
chain threat score that likely overestimates the risk posed by the Site. TAI commented that this approach is 
inconsistent with Site conditions and is not supported by RI/FS data.  
 TAI commented that the metals in the historically released slag have limited bioavailability. TAI asserted that the 
slow release rates of metals from slag are evident at the Site, as indicated by the low concentrations of metals in 
surface water from the Upper Columbia River.  
 
Response : The waste characteristics factor category value was correctly calculated in accordance with the HRS in 
the HRS documentation record at proposal. The related factor values (i.e., the hazardous waste quantity factor value, toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation) used in the waste characteristics factor category value calculation were also properly assigned in the HRS documentation record at proposal.  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 57  In discussing the procedure to evaluate the human food chain threat waste characteristics, HRS Section 4.1.3.2, 
Human food chain threat -waste characteristics, states to “[e]valuate the waste characteristics factor category for 
each watershed based on two factors: toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation and hazardous waste quantity.”  
 HRS Section 4.1.3.2.2, Hazardous waste quantity , instructs to “[a] ssign  the same factor value for hazardous waste  
quantity for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.1.2.2.2 for the drinking water threat. ” HRS Section, 
4.1.2.2.2, Hazardous waste quantity , in turn states to “[a] ssign a  hazardous waste quantity factor value for  the 
watershed as specified in section 2.4.2.” HRS Section 2.4.2, Hazardous waste quantity , in relevant part at 2.4.2.2, 
states:   
 
Sum the source hazardous  waste quantity values assigned to all sources (including the unallocated 
source) or areas  of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface 
contamination  for the pathway being evaluated and round this sum to the nearest integer, except:  
If the sum is greater than 0, but less  than 1, round it to 1. Based on this value, select  a hazardous 
waste quantity factor value for the pathway from Table 2–6.

HRS Section 4.1.3.2.1.4, Calculation of toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value , states how the 
bioaccumulation potential factor value is used to determine the toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value 
for a hazardous substance:  
 
Assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence factor value from Table 4 –12, based on 
the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and persistence factors. Then assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value from Table 4–16, based on the values assigned for the toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation potential 
factors. Use the hazardous substance with the highest toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed to assign the value to this factor. Enter this value in Table 4–1.  
 HRS Section 4.1.3.2.3, Calculation of human food chain threat -waste characteristics factor category value, 
describes how a bioaccumulation potential factor value is used to calculate a human food chain threat -waste 
characteristics factor category for the watershed:  
 
For the hazardous substance selected for the watershed in section 4.1.3.2.1.4, use its toxicity/persistence factor value and bioaccumulation potential factor value as follows to assign a 
value to the waste characteristics factor category. First, multiply t he toxicity/persistence factor 
value and the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1x10
8. Then multiply this product by the bioaccumulation potential factor value for 
this hazardous substance, subject to a  maximum product of 1x1012. Based on this second product, Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 58  assign a value from Table 2 –7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the human food chain threat- waste 
characteristics factor category for the watershed. Enter this value in Table 4 –1.

the hazardous waste quantity factor value for that pathway [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.2]. Therefore, a hazardous waste quantity factor value of 1,000,000 is assigned for the surface water migration 
pathway.

4.1.3.2.3 Waste Characteristics Factor Category Value  
 
Mercury and cadmium are documented in observed releases and associated with Sources 1, 2, and 
3, which have a surface water pathway containment factor value greater than 0 for the watershed 
and correspond to a toxicity/persistence factor value of 10,000 and bioaccumulation potential 
factor value of 50,000, as shown above [Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.1.4; 2, pp. 12, 32].  
 
(Toxicity/Persistence Factor Value) x (Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value) =  
10,000 x 1,000,000 = 1 x 1010  
(Subject to a maximum of 1 x 108)  
[Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.3]  
 
(Toxicity/Persistence Factor Value x Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value) x  
(Bioaccumulation Potential Factor Value) = (1 x 108) x (50,000) = 5 x 1012  
(Subject to a maximum of 1 x 1012)  
[Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.3]  
 
The resulting waste characteristics product of 1 x 1012 corresponds to a Waste Characteristics 
Factor Category Value of 1,000 in Table 2-7 of the HRS [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.3.1]. 
 
Thus, the HRS documentation record at proposal evaluated each of the related factor values (i.e., toxicity, 
persistence, bioaccumulation, and hazardous waste quantity factor values) to determine the waste characteristics factor category value consistent with the HRS. The hazardous waste quantity factor value was based on the 
combined sum of the Sources 1 -3 hazardous waste quantity values and HRS Table 2- 6 as presented above in the 
quoted text from page 82 of the HRS documentation record at proposal. The tox icity, persistence, and 
bioaccumulation factor values were determined based on an eligible hazardous substance as presented on page 82 
of the HRS documentation record at proposal, quoted above. As noted on page 83 of the HRS documentation 
record at proposal, mercury and cadmium were determined to be the highest scoring hazardous substances with 
identical values for toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation. These values associated with mercury and  cadmium 
were used to calculate the waste characteristics fact or category value (i.e., 5 x 10
12, subject to a maximum of 1 x 
1012) in accordance with the HRS as presented in calculations on page 83 of the HRS documentation record at 
proposal.   
Regarding the bioavailability of metals in sediments,  the HRS does not consider the bioavailability of hazardous 
substances in an HRS evaluation. 
 
Regarding the rate of release of metals from slag to water, for source material that has already migrated into a 
pathway medium— i.e., slag in surface water sediments for the Site— the HRS scoring factors for the surface 
water migration pathway do not consider this  rate. That is, HRS scoring does not consider the rate that metals 
from waste material in sediment might dissolve into the water. Therefore, t his type of leaching process is  not 
considered in the HRS site score.  
 As these comments relate to the risk posed by the Site, please see section 3.15, Risk to Human Health or the 
Environment, of this support document for the discussion of site- related risk.

3.21.4  H
uman Food Chain Threat - Targets  
Comment: TAI provided comments discussing the level of contamination in fish. TAI commented that a 
misleading statement27 is present in the HRS documentation record at proposal that misidentifies the author28 of a 
fish consumption Technical Summary. TAI asserted that while an advisory acknowledges contamination, the EPA 
determined that fish from the Columbia River are generally safe for consumption. TAI commented that low levels 
of lead are present in fish species except for largescale suckers, which are not widely consumed. TAI also stated 
that hazardous substances unrelated to the Site may be the driver behind fish advisories in place for sensitive groups.  
Response : Insomuch as these comments question the scoring of the human food chain threat of the HRS  and the 
presence of a human food chain fishery, fishing for human consumption within the zone of actual contamination was sufficiently documented to score the human food chain threat.  
HRS
 Section 4.1.3.3, Human food chain threat- targets, provides instructions for evaluating targets in the 
human food chain threat and states in relevant part:  
Eval
uate two target factors for each watershed: food chain individual and population. For both 
factors, determine whether the target fisheries are subject to actual or potential human food chain 
contamination. 
Consider a fishery (or portion of a fishery) within the target distance limit of the watershed to be 
subject to actual human food chain contamination if any of the following apply: 
•A hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater
is present either in an observed release by direct observation to the watershed or in a
surface water or sediment sample from the watershed at a level that meets the cr iteria for
an observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is
within the boundaries of the observed release (that is, it is located either at the point of
direct observation or at or between the probable point of e ntry and the most distant
sampling point establishing the observed release)….  
When a fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to actual food chain contamination, determine 
the part of the fishery subject to Level I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations. If the actual food chain contamination is based on direct observation, evaluate it 
using Level II concentrations. However, if the actual food chain contamination is based on 
samples from the watershed, use these samples and, if available, additional tissue samples from 
aquatic human food chain organisms as specified below, to determine the part subject to Level I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations: 
•Determine the level of actual contamination from samples (including tissue samples from
essentially sessile, benthic organisms) that meet the criteria for actual food chain
contamination by comparing the exposure concentrations (see section 4.1.2.3) from these
samples (or comparable samples) to the health -based benchmarks from table 4 -17, as
described in section 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use only the exposure concentrations for those
27 TAI referred to page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, pointing to the following statement, “[a] WSDH fish 
consumption advisory Technical Summary (d ated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a primary source  of metals and 
other chemical contaminants in the UCR [Ref. 52, p. 1].” 
28 TAI asserted  that the referen ce document identifies the EPA as the author of the statement, which stat es that “‘[t]he U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified the Trail Smelter operated by Teck Cominco (now called Teck) as the 
primary source of metals.’” Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 61  hazardous substances in the sample (or comparable samples) that meet the criteria for 
actual contamination of the fishery.  
 
HRS Section 4.1.3.3.2.2, Level II concentrations, provides instructions for the evaluation a fishery subject to 
Level II concentrations. It states:  
 
Determine those fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to Level 
II concentrations. Do not include any fisheries (or portions of fisheries) already counted under the 
Level I concentrations factor.  
 
Assign each fishery (or portion of a fishery) a value for human food chain population from table 
4–18, based on the estimated human food production for the fishery. Estimate the human food 
chain production for the fishery as specified in section 4.1.3.3.2.1.  
 In describing the targets eligible for scoring in the human food chain threat , page 84 of the HRS documentation 
record at proposal indicate d: 
 
4.1.3.3 Human Food Chain Threat - Targets  
 The zone of actual contamination is the area of the UCR between the most upstream PPE (PPE1) 
and farthest downstream observed release sample (EV001 -SED -1-092619). As stated previously, 
contamination and targets are not scored for the portion of the UCR loc ated in Canada (i.e., 
between PPE1 and the U.S. -Canada border). Scored contamination and targets are evaluated for 
the U.S. portion of the zone of contamination, which encompasses a length of approximately 35 
miles [ Figure 3 of this HRS documentation recor d].  
 
There is an observed release of metals contaminants to the UCR [see Section 4.1.2.1.1 of this 
HRS documentation record], which is used for consumption fishing. Species caught for 
consumption in the UCR from the U.S.–Canada border to Marcus Washington (and within the 
scored zone of actual contamination) include walleye, sturgeon, rainbow trout, kokanee, and 
northern pike [Refs. 24, p. 1; 56, p. 1]. The original north boundary of the Colville Indian 
Reservation was the Canadian border; this former “North Half ” of the Colville Indian Reservation 
continues to be an important homeland to the CCT. The CCT exercises certain management and 
regulatory authority in this area from the northern boundary of the current reservation north to the 
Canadian border, bounded by the Okanogan and Columbia rivers. CCT -owned land and 
individual tribal members reside on the North Half and use the lands, waters, and natural 
resources for cultural and subsistence uses as they do on the reservation [Refs. 17, p. 61; 20, pp. 
1-2; 21, pp. 1-2, 4].  
 The Washington State Department of Health (WSDH) has a fish advisory in place for the 
consumption of various fish due to mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concerns. The 
advisory covers the portion of the UCR from the U.S.- Canada border to the Grand Coulee Dam. 
Guidelines are in place for the consumption of species within the UCR including kokanee, lake 
whitefish, rainbow trout, white sturgeon, northern pike, burbot, longnose sucker, mountain 
whitefish, smallmouth bass, walleye, largescale sucker, a nd largemouth bass. A do- not-eat 
advisory is in place for northern pikeminnow [Ref. 23, p. 1]. A WSDH fish consumption advisory 
Technical Summary (dated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a primary source of metals 
and other chemical contaminants in the UCR [Ref. 52, p. 1].

with targets in the human food chain threat  and stated: 
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 62  4.1.3.3.2.2 Level II Concentrations  
 
The zone of actual contamination is the area of the UCR between the most upstream PPE (PPE1) 
and farthest downstream observed release sample (EV001- SED -1-092619)…. The scored zone of 
actual contamination in the UCR is used for consumption fishing [Refs. 24, p. 1; 56, p. 1]. 
Species caught for consumption in the scored zone of actual contamination include walleye, 
sturgeon, rainbow trout, kokanee and northern pike [Refs. 24, p. 1, 56. p. 1].  
 
The food chain production for the fishery is not documented, so based on the aforementioned information, the fishery is assigned to the category “Greater than 0 to 100 pounds per year,” 
which corresponds to the assigned human food chain population value of 0.03 in Table 4-18 of 
the HRS [Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.3.2.2]. The available documentation demonstrates that fishing for human consumption occurs within the scored zone of actual contamination delineated by metals 
detected in sediment samples at concentrati ons meeting observed release criteria (i.e., 
significantly above background and attributable to the site); therefore, the target fishery is evaluated for Level II actual contamination [ Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 1, 
Section 4.1.3.3; 24, p. 1]. 
 
Page 86 of the HRS documentation record at proposal cited References 24 and 56. Reference 24 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, a phone conversation record with a manager for a fishing tour company, states:  
 
Mr. Lawson stated that although the guided tours target rainbow trout, which are caught and released, he knows that the portion of the Upper Columbia River from the U.S- Canada border to 
Marcus, Washington is fished for consumption. Species caught for consu mption include walleye, 
sturgeon, rainbow trout and northern pike. 
 
Reference 56 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, a phone conversation record with a retired professor 
of biology from Eastern Washington University, states:  
 
Professor Scholz also informed me that this portion of the UCR (between the U.S.-Canada border and Marcus, WA) is fished for consumption. Species caught for consumption include walleye, red 
band trout (a type of rainbow trout), kokanee, white sturgeon, and northern pike. He also 
informed me that Colville Tribes still fish the UCR for subsistence, including the North Half, 
which fished the upper portion of the UCR between the U.S.-Canada border border [ sic] and 
Marcus, WA.
 
 
Thus, the HRS documentation record at proposal provided sufficient documentation to support that a human food chain fishery is present at the Site to score a fishery as a target for HRS scoring purposes. Consistent with the 
HRS instructions regarding identifying a fishery subject to actual human food chain contamination, the HRS 
documentation record at proposal documented that fish are caught and consumed from within the zone of actual 
contamination t o establish that a Level II fishery.  
 
Regarding Reference 52 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, while this reference was used to help 
provide context regarding the presence of a fishery as indicated on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at 
proposal, this reference was not relied on to document a fishery within the zone of contamination at the Site. As 
noted above, two records of conversation (one each in References 24 and 56 ) were used to document the presence 
of a human food chain fishery within the zone of contamination. See section 3.18, Non -Scoring HRS 
Documentation Record Comments, of this support document for clarifications related to Reference 52 and associated HRS documentation record text.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 63  3.22 Soil Exposure Component  
Comment: TAI and Stevens County commented that it is unclear whether scoring the upland soil contamination 
would achieve an NPL eligible score. TAI asserted that it is also unlikely that the soil contamination would 
achieve a sufficient HRS site score as properties above the Action Level have been remediated and the area is 
rural.  
 
TAI and Stevens County provided comments questioning whether the areas with contaminated soil were 
appropriately evaluated and considered residential. TAI asserted that the extent of the residential soil 
contamination described in general EPA communications is overstated because non -residential land use areas are 
included. Stevens County commented that areas categorized as residential for scoring also include forest, industrial, and commercial areas. It stated that EPA representatives have alluded to the ar ea as residential even 
though many of the sampling areas are zoned as forest. It commented that it could identify where residential 
development may occur. It asserted that the other non- residential areas that have been sampled are not eligible as 
residenti al areas for scoring or eligible under the soil lead guidance. Stevens County concluded that the resulting 
scoring of these non- residential areas is incorrect.  
 TAI asserted that the soil contamination, as opposed to the entire Upper Columbia River site, appears to be the 
possible justification for placing the Site on the NPL. TAI acknowledged that the soil contamination may involve properties below future cleanup levels, but also stated that the presence “of some areas with lead concentrations 
above EPA’s new screening levels is not an appropriate basis for Listing a particular site.”  
 
Response: Insomuch as the commenter’s assertions are related to the evaluation of the soil exposure component, 
the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway was properly scored in 
accordance with the HRS in delineating an AOC. Further, when an HRS score is calculated, each individual 
pathway does not need to achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score, as the HRS site score is based on a 
combination of the individual pathway scores. In this case, the HRS evaluation of the Site included the surface 
water migration pathway in addition to the soil exposure component in scoring, and the Site achieved an NPL 
eligible HRS site score of 51.15 , which is above the minimum threshold for NPL placement. 
 
The commenters’ specific points regarding scoring the soil exposure component, property types, and soil sample 
concentrations do not affect or invalidate the HRS site score:  
 
• On the subject of what properties are eligible for consideration in the delineating the AOC, the AOC is 
delineated based on samples meeting observed contamination criteria. T he HRS does not  restrict observed 
contamination to a specific property type.  
• On the subject of the pathway- specific score achieved by the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, 
the HRS does not require that an individual pathway independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score.  
• On the subject of the presence of properties with soil contamination below an action level, residents may be eligible for scoring in the soil exposure component even if located at properties with soil sample 
concentrations below an action level.  
 
In presenting the instructions for determining eligible soil contamination, HRS Section 5.1.0, General considerations , states:  
 
• Establish areas of observed contamination based on sampling locations at which there is  
observed contamination as follows.  
- For all sources except contaminated soil, if observed contamination from the site is 
present at any sampling location within the source, consider that entire source to be an 
area of  observed contamination.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 64  - For contaminated soil, consider both the sampling location(s) with observed 
contamination from the  site and the area lying between such locations to be an area of 
observed contamination, unless  available information indicates otherwise.  
• If an area of observed contamination (or portion of such an area) is covered by a permanent, 
or otherwise maintained, essentially impenetrable material (for example, asphalt) that is not 
more  than 2 feet thick, exclude that area (or portion of the area) in evaluating the soil 
exposure  component.  
• For an area of observed contamination, consider only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria  for observed contamination for that area to be associated with that area in 
evaluating the soil exposure  component (see section 2.2.2).  
 Further instructions for assessing the resident population threat are presented in HRS Section 5.1.1, Resident 
population threat . This section states:  
 
Evaluate the resident population threat only if there is an area of observed contamination in one or more of the following locations:  
• Within the property boundary of a residence, school, or day care center and within 
200 feet of the respective residence, school, or day care center, or  
• Within a workplace property boundary and within 200 feet of a workplace area, or  
• Within the boundaries of a resource specified in section 5.1.1.3.4, or  
• Within the boundaries of a terrestrial sensitive environment specified in section 5. 1.1.3.5 
[emphasis added]  
 
For assessing the targets factor category, HRS Section 5.1.1.3, Targets , instructs a scorer, in part, to:  
 
Evaluate the targets factor category for the resident population threat based on five factors: 
resident individual, resident population, workers, resources, and terrestrial sensitive 
environments.  
In evaluating the targets factor category for the resident population threat, count only the following as targets:  
• Resident individual – a person living or attending school or day care on a property with 
an area of observed contamination and whose residence, school, or day care center, 
respectively,  is on or within 200 feet of the areas of observed contamination.  
• Worker – a person working on a property with an area of observed contamination and 
whose  workplace area is on or within 200 feet of the area of observed contamination.…  
 
In describing the scoring of the AOC, page 92 of the HRS documentation record at proposal state d:  
 
AOC A is defined by a polygon bounded by soil contamination meeting HRS observed contamination criteria (i.e., locations showing lead and arsenic at concentrations significantly 
above published background levels and collected from the top 2 feet of soil) … However, since 
EPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area dating back to 2003 [see Site Summary section of this HRS documentation record], not all properties were 
included within the AOC polygon; for the purpose of deter mining the hazardous waste quantity 
area and resident population for the AOC, a conservative approach was taken and only 
contaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did not have soil removals, were 
included in the calculation …. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024

EPA has identified 16 properties with dwellings that are affected by the AOC. Four of these 
properties are subject to Level I contamination of arsenic (based on sample results greater than the cancer risk screening concentration benchmark of 0.772 mg/kg); 12 properties are subject to Level II contamination of lead (no benchmark established) .

The HRS documentation record at proposal properly identified eligible samples to establish an AOC for HRS 
scoring and correctly identified the population associated with eligible residences.  The AOC was determined 
based on soil samples meeting observed contamination criteria for lead and/or arsenic as specified in HRS Section 
5.1.0. The commenter has not challenged the evaluation of whether particular samples used to delineate the AOC 
met observed contamination criteria. In accordance with the instructions in HRS Sections 5.1.0, 5.1.1, and 5.1.1.3, 
and as presented on pages 92, 100, 102, 103, 107, and 108 of the HRS documentation record at proposa l, quoted 
above, eligible residents were determined based on either inferred contamination on residences being located 
within the AOC or samples meeting observed contamination criteria that were collected on the property and 
within 200 feet of a residence. Thus, the HRS documentation record at proposal identified eligible residents 
during the evaluation of the population associated with eligible residences consistent with the HRS requirements.  
 
The HRS does not require that an individual pathway independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score. The 
HRS site score, which takes into account the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway score, is greater than the NPL placement threshold of 28.50 making this Site eligible for placement on the NPL. The soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathw ay score of 21.66 does not independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score; 
however, per HRS Section 2.1.1, Calculation of HRS site score , an HRS site score is calculated using the pathway 
scores from all four pathways for the Site. At this Site, the surface water migration pathway was also evaluated 
and received a pathway score of 100.00. Following the HRS methodology and accounting for the scores from the 
two pathways scored, the resulting HRS site score is 51.15 making the Site eligible for NPL placement. The rationale for placing the Site on the NPL is in part due to the Site achieving an NPL eligible HRS site score based 
on the evaluation of both the surface water migration and the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway s 
consistent with the HRS requirements for scoring a site.   
Regarding the consideration of the  action level in determining eligible samples and residents, as explained above 
in section 3.16, Regulatory Limits and Screening Levels, of this support document, contamination below an action 
level or other screening level may still be eligible for consideration in documenting observed contamination. The 
HRS uses the criteria for observed contamination as specified in HRS Section 5.1.0, quoted above, to evaluate the soil exposure component. As explained above, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly determined 
which soil samples met observed contamination criteria, which is not challenged by the commenter. Residences and associated residents were also correctly calculated as explained above.  
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The original HRS score for this site was 5 1.15. Based on the above responses to public comments, the score 
remains unchanged. The final scores for the Upper Columbia River site are:  
 
Ground Water:      Not S cored  
Surface Water:       100.00 
Soil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion:   21.66

Re: concurrence on Superfund listing of the Upper Columbia River Site 
Dear Administrator Sixkiller: 
I received your letter dated November 30, 2023 in regard to the proposed addition of the Upper Columbia 
River ("UCR") Site to the Superfund National Priorities List ("NPL"). The Colville Tribes supports placement 
of the UCR Site on the NPL. 
The UCR Site includes areas within the traditional homeland, and current Reservation, of the Colville 
Tribes. Historical disposal and discharges of wastes and emissions from smelter operations have 
contaminated the UCR Site and pose a risk to human health as well as to the sovereignty and economic 
security of the Colville Tribes. 
As you correctly note in your letter, the Colville Tribes has worked for at least two decades to address the 
legacy of contamination at the UCR Site, including litigation with our partners in the federal government, the 
State of Washington, and the Spokane Tribe of Indians. An NPL listing will allow access to resources that 
are much needed for remediation of the UCR Site. 
The Colville Tribes appreciates and accepts your offer to coordinate with our staff as the NPL listing 
process proceeds. Thank you for this effort to bring maximum resources to this remediation as quickly as 
possible.

NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST (NPL) 
***Proposed NPL Site*** September 2024 
HISTORIC POTTERIES Trenton, New Jersey 
Mercer County 
Site Location: 
The Historic Potteries site consists primarily of residential, public school, and public park properties in or around the East 
Trenton and Top Road neighborhood in the city of Trenton, Mercer County, New Jersey, although commercial and industrial 
properties may also be contaminated. 
Site History: 
The pottery industry was prominent in Trenton, with a major hub in the East Trenton and Top Road neighborhoods. The 
industry grew from the 1850s until the 1920s, when more than 50 potteries operat ed simultaneously; products included 
tableware, art ceramics, sanitary ware, and electrical porcelain. Residential development of the area coincided with the industrial activity. The pottery industry began to shrink considerably during the Great Depression; as it waned, some of the 
historic pottery locations were converted to additional residential property. Lead was commonly used in glazes that were 
subject ed to very high temperatures in the firing kilns, causing lead to be released into the air via the kiln exhaust and then 
settle onto soil downwind from the kilns. Soil containing ceramic pieces was likely used as fill material during residential 
development and may also be a source of lead contamination. In 2018 the State of New Jersey and City of Trenton notified 
the EPA that the neighborhood of East Trenton was contaminated with lead. 
Site Contamination/Contaminants: 
Soil is contaminated with lead at levels that exceed the Removal Management Level (RML). 
Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment: 
The soil contamination potentially affects 542 intermediate school students and their faculty and administrators, as well as at 
least 226 residents in the East Trenton and Top Road neighborhoods. 
Response Activities (to date): 
The EPA began investigating a former solder manufacturer in East Trenton in 2018 and found elevated lead levels on nearby 
residential properties. However, the EPA determined that the lead contamination was not caused by the solder manufacturer. 
Beginning in 2020, the EPA performed extensive research and a field investigation to determine whether the former potteries caused lead contamination in the soil. The EPA began sampling residential properties, schools, and parks within the Top Road and East Trenton neighborhoods in 2023. Upon discovery of lead contamination on school property, the EPA started work 
with the school district to develop a plan that would protect the school community from lead contamination in the soil. School 
officials have closed play areas, and the EPA installed temporary protective covers over the impacted areas. Additional 
removal actions are anticipated to address lead contaminated soil at residential properties and parks in East Trenton. 
Need for NPL Listing: 
In 2020 the State of New Jersey requested that the EPA evaluate the site for a removal action and possible inclusion on the 
NPL because of the lead contamination that was discovered in East Trenton. Other federal and state cleanup response 
programs were evaluated but are not viable at this time because of the potential ly large number of properties that will require 
cleanup and the significant resources need ed to continue to characterize the contaminated areas. In June 2024 the State 
nominated the site for inclusion on the NPL. 
[The description of the site (release) is based on information available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS. The description may 
change as additional information is gathered on the sources and extent of contamination. See 56 FR 5600, February 11, 1991, or subsequent 
FR notices.]

Pathways, Components or Threats Not Scored 
The ground water, surface water, and air migration pathways, as well as the nearby population threat of the soil 
exposure component and the subsurface intrusion component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway , 
are not scored in this Hazard Ranking System (HRS) documentation record because the resident population threat 
of the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway is sufficient to qualify the 
site for the National Priorities Li st (NPL). The ground water, surface water, and air migration pathways, and the 
nearby population threat of the soil exposure component and the subsurface intrusion component of the soil 
exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway , may be considered during a future evaluation. At the time of the listing, 
the site score is sufficient without, and the listing of the site would not be changed by , the addition of the threats,

* The street address, coordinates, and contaminant locations presented in this HRS documentation record identify 
the general area where the site is located. They represent one or more locations EPA considers to be part of the site 
based on the screening in formation EPA used to evaluate the site for National Priority List (NPL) listing. EPA lists 
national priorities among the known "releases or threatened releases" of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on 
the release, not precisely delineated boundarie s. A site is defined as where a hazardous substance has been 
"deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has otherwise come to be located." Generally, HRS scoring and the 
subsequent listing of a release merely represent the initial determination that a cer tain area may need to be addressed 
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Accordingly, 
EPA contemplates that the preliminary description of facility boundaries at the time of scoring will be refined as 
more information is developed as to where the contamination has come to be located.

       SITE DESCRIPTION 
The Historic Potteries site (EPA ID No. NJN000203535 ) in Trenton, NJ , as scored for HRS purposes, consists of 
the release of a hazardous substance (i.e., lead) from historical pottery operations resulting in an area of observed 
contamination (AOC) that is delineated based on the presence of lead in the top 2 feet of soil on residential properties 
and school grounds [see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record ]. The affected properties include a school 
with a student population of 542 and full -time faculty level of 45, and 84 occupied residential properties with an 
estimated total population of 2 26.96 [see Section 5.1. 1.3 of this HRS documentation record ]. Figure 1 of this HRS 
documentation record presents a Site Location Map showing former pottery locations and approximate known 
extent of the contaminated soil AOC , Figure s 1a and 1b of this HRS documentation record present the background 
sampling locations used for defining the AOC, Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record shows the site study 
area and the locations of properties sampled by EPA, and Figures 3 through 3i of this HRS documentation record 
provide additional d etail regarding the AOC including sampling locations and levels of contamination . 
The Historic Potteries site is in the East Trenton and Top Road neighborhoods of Trenton, Mercer County, New 
Jersey [Refs. 3, p. 1; 6, pp. 10, 13] . In 2018 , EPA began an investigation in East Trenton and found lead levels 
above the EPA Removal Management Level (RML) on residential properties [Refs. 6, p. 6; 11, p. 1; 12, pp. 5 –6]. 
Due to the histor y of the area, where numerous industrial -scale potteries formerly operated, EPA began investigating 
the pottery industry as the potential source of the elevated lead levels in 2020 [Refs. 6, p p. 8–11; 7, pp. 2 –5; 11, p. 
1; 12, p. 5] . Through its research, EPA identified a bout 80 locations throughout Trenton where one or more potter y 
manufacturing businesses had formerly operated; about half of these locations housed large -scale operations and 
more than 30 were located in and around the East Trenton/Top Road area [Refs. 6, pp. 8 –10]. These industrial -scale 
potteries operated in the area over variable timeframes between the 1850s and the mid-20th century [Refs. 6, p. 10; 
7, pp. 2 –5; 8, p. 2; 9, pp. 1, 3; 37, p. 5 ; 44, pp. 1, 6 –39]. In 1850, just one industrial pottery was operating in Trenton 
[Ref. 7, p. 4; 8, p. 2; 44, p. 37]. However, t he industry grew increasingly prominent in the city from the 1850s until 
the 1920s (in 1924, more than 50 facilities were operating simultaneously in Trenton), when it began to shrink 
considerably during the Great Depression [Refs. 7, pp. 4 –5; 8, p. 2; 9, p. 1; 10, p. 3; 38, pp. 74 –76; 44, pp. 6 –42]. 
The reasons for the growth of the pottery industry in Trenton from the 1850s until the 1920s were the city’s central 
location with respect to markets ( New York and Philadelphia ) and its role as a hub in the regional transportation 
network of canals and railroads [Refs. 6, p. 8; 7, p. 4 ; 43, p p. 1, 3]. The surge of industrial pottery development 
occurred primari ly along the Delaware and Raritan Canal , which was built in 1834 and separates East Trenton and 
Top Road; the canal and adjacent railroad tracks provided easy delivery of raw materials ( e.g., central New Jersey 
clays and eastern Pennsylvania coals ) to the potteries and transport of finished goods from the potteries [Ref. 7, pp. 
4–5; 11, p. 2; 43, pp. 1, 3–5, 7, 8 ; 51, p. 2 ]. Historical maps from 1 835, 1874, and 1882 provide evidence of the 
industrial pottery development in the East Trenton/Top Road area —the 1 835 map shows the area to be significantly 
less developed, whereas the 1874 and 1882 maps show industrial potteries in clusters along the canal and adjacent 
railroad track s, and individual potteries at other locations in the East Trenton/Top Road area [Refs. 45, p.1; 46, pp. 
1–4; 47, p. 1]. Historical maps from 1930 show additional potteries in the area, including in the easternmost portion 
of the East Trenton/Top Road area [Ref. 48, pp. 2, 31 –38, 50 ]. Several of the former pottery locations in the East 
Trenton/Top Road area are within the documented AOC, and most others within the East Trenton/Top Road area 
are clustered near the documented AOC in areas that were not sampled by EPA [Ref. 46, pp. 1 -4; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 
2-11; see Figure 2 and Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation Record]. D evelopment of the East Trenton and 
Top Road r esidential neighborhoods coincid ed with the industrial growth as a means to support the potteries and 
other industries [Ref. 18, p. 5; 47, p, 1; 48, pp. 2, 31 –38, 50 ; 51, p. 2] . As the industry waned, some of the historical 
pottery locations in the East Trenton/Top Road area were converted to other uses including residential [Refs. 6, pp. 
10, 13; 43, p. 2 ; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 2, 31 –38, 50 ]. 
Potteries in Trenton manufactured tableware, sanitary ware, electrical porcelain , and art ceramics [Refs. 7, p. 12; 9, 
pp. 1, 3; 10, p. 2; 37, pp. 5 –8; 38, pp. 74 –76; 44, pp. 6 –42]. Lead was used in the ceramic glazes required for the 
manufacture of many of these products, which were subject to high temperatures in the firing kilns [Refs . 7, pp. 6 – 
7, 13; 38, pp. 35 –42; 39, pp. 47 –52, 60 –65, 72; 40, pp. 35 –36, 45 –57; 41, pp. 2 –3]. The number of pottery kilns in 
Trenton increased from 1 to 258 between 1852 an d 1903 [Ref. 38, p. 76]. Depictions of the Trenton kilns show 
smoke emanating from their stacks and moving with the wind; lead would have been released in these kiln emissions

       and then settle into the soil downwind from the kilns (the prevailing wind direction in Trenton is northwesterly, and 
a large majority of wind direction is distributed across the western half from northerly to southerly) [Refs. 6, pp. 9, 
11, 13; 7, p. 10; 37, p. 5; 33, p. 13; 39, pp. 182 –198; 41, p p. 2, 3; 42, pp. 2 –3; 43, p. 1 ; 56, p. 5 ]. Soil and debris 
containing ceramic pieces that was used as fill material during development of the residential neighborhoods is also 
adding to the lead contamination [Ref s. 6, p. 11; 11, p. 2 ; 53, pp. 2 –852; see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS 
documentation record ]. 
During multiple sampling events from October 2020 to July 2022, EPA sampled residential properties , public 
properties , and industrial properties within the study area for the Historic Potteries site [Refs. 12 , pp. 1, 12–28; 13, 
pp. 1, 13–19; 14, pp. 1, 13–21; 15, pp. 1, 13–16; 16, pp. 1, 13–17; 17, pp. 1, 14–16; 18, pp. 1, 6–9, 15 –27]. During 
these sampling events, EPA found pottery sherds (i.e., ceramic chips) within the contaminated soils on many 
properties to have lead field screening levels that were above EPA RMLs [Refs. 12, pp. 68–70, 76, 81 , 87–88, 99, 
111, 115; 13, pp. 46, 55, 57, 58; 14, pp. 60, 69, 74; 15, pp. 51, 61, 62; 16, pp. 45, 50, 63; 17, pp. 48 –49, 
56–57, 59, 66 –67; 18, pp. 5 –8, 11 –12, 53 –54, 63 –64, 68, 70 –71, 74, 90 –92, 101, 117, 129, 1 31; 33, pp. 2 –3, 8]. 
EPA collected and analyzed some of the pottery sherds and reported lead levels up to 5,737 mg/kg [Ref. 18, pp. 6 – 
8]. T he presence of lead concentrations elevated above RMLs at shallow depths is consistent with the presence of 
ceramic chips at similar depths and aerial deposition of kiln emissions from upwind historical pottery operations 
[Ref. 33, p. 18 ]. EPA found lead to be one of the most leachable metals from the ceramic chips, indicating that 
leaching of lead from the chips over ti me is one of the mechanisms of soil contamination [Ref. 33, pp. 10 –13, 18]. 
In 2023 and 2024, EPA performed additional sampling of residential properties , schools, and p arks in the Top Road 
and East Trenton neighborhoods , as well as background locations outside the historic potteries area [Ref. 22, pp. 2 – 
73; 53, pp. 1, 853 –956; 54, pp. 2 –6; 55, p p. 2–4, 7–8; see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record] . All 
samples were c ollected within the top 2 feet of soil , and residential/school property samples were collected within 
200 feet of the residence or school/workplace [ Ref. 5 4, pp. 2 –3; see Section 5.1.0 and Figures 3a through 3i of 
this HRS documentation record ]. Results for the Grant Intermediate School, where there are 5 42 students and 45 
full-time faculty members , show lead concentrations more than three times above background levels in several 
grass -and soil -covered areas on school grounds [see Tables 2, 3, 4, 7 , and 8 of this HRS documentation record ]. 
The lead levels for the surface soil samples collected throughout the school grounds exceed the recently updated 
EPA Re moval Management Level (R ML) of 200 mg/kg [Refs. 6, pp. 14 –15; 36, pp. 1 –2]. Therefore, EPA i s 
performing interim actions to protect the school community from the lead contamination in the soil , including 
temporary restriction to contaminated areas until protective measures are installed (i.e., clean cover material in the 
main play areas and temporary fencing around low use areas) [Refs. 6, pp. 17 –18]. 
In addition to the lead contamination at the school, analytical results show that lead contamination more than three 
times above the site -specific background level affects 84 occupied residential properties and four vacant residential 
or community properties [see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record] . EPA encountered evidence of 
pottery waste fill (i.e., ceramic debris) at 84 of the 8 9 properties within the documented AOC, including the school 
[see Tables 3 and 4 of this HRS documentation record]. 
For the Historic Potteries site, EPA is evaluating the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway —soil exposure 
component . The results of the 2023 -2024 sampling investigation document the presence of a hazardous substance 
(lead) at levels that meet the criteria for observed contamination in soil at a school and at 84 occupied residential 
properties; the observed contamination on each property is within 200 feet of each respective structure . The data 
document Level II concentrations affecting a resident population of 768.96 (i.e., 5 42 students and 226.96 resident s). 
The AOC also affects at least 45 full-time workers (i.e., the school faculty) . Older data not used in the HRS scoring 
evaluation indicates that the AO C probably extend s to numerous other occupied residential , public, and commercial 
properties within the AOC ; that there is spatial correlation of former pottery location s and the lead contamination ; 
and that the isotopic composition of soil lead can be correlated to the isotopic composition of co -located ceramic 
chips in many cases [Refs. 12, pp. 12 –73; 13, pp. 13 –47; 14, pp. 13 –61; 15, pp. 13 –52; 16, pp. 13 –45; 17, pp. 14 – 
50; 18, pp. 6 –9, 15 –55; 33, pp. 1–3, 8, 10 –13, 18–19]. The site as scored for HRS purposes and presented in this 
HRS documentation record includes one AOC with documented Level II concentrations of a hazardous substance 
23  
          
 
  (lead) ; this contamination originat ed from the numerous historic potteries that operated in the area . As is shown in 
this HRS documentation record, the site qualifies for listing on the NPL based on the HRS score.

   5.0 SOIL EXPOSURE AND SUBSURFACE INTRUSION PATHWAY 
5.0.1 EXPOSURE COMPONENTS 
Component(s) being scored: 
The s oil exposure component is scored based on the resident population threat as detailed in the following sections 
of this HRS documentation record [Ref. 1, Section s 5.1 and 5.1.0]. 
5.1 SOIL EXPOSURE COMPONENT 
5.1.0 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
According to the HRS, the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway is based 
on observed contamination and AOC s [Ref. 1, Section 5.1.0 ]. All soil samp les meeting the criteria for observed 
contamination at the Historic Potteries site were collected at depth intervals within the top 2 feet below ground 
surface ( bgs), as documented in Table 3 of this HRS documentation record . All sample s were collected, processed, 
and analyzed according to the same procedures [Refs. 19, pp. 15, 21, 34, 44; 20, pp. 16, 36, 46 ; 53, p. 1 ]. Analytical 
results for soil samples indicate that lead is present at concentrations equal to or greater than three times the 
establish ed background level and at concentrations greater than the corresponding sample quantitation limits (SQL) , 
meeting the criteria for observed contamination [Ref. 1, Section 5.1.0 and Table 2-3] [see Tables 2 and 4 of this 
HRS documentation record] . 
Area of Observed Contamination 
Letter by which this AOC is to be identified: A 
Name and description of the AOC : AOC A is composed of contaminated surface soils within school , residential , 
and vacant properties that meet the criteria for observed contamination for lead in the residential neighborhood s of 
East Trenton and Top Road, Trenton, Mercer County, New Jersey [see Figure s 2 and 3 and Tables 2 and 4 of this 
HRS documentation record] . 
Type of AOC : Contaminated soil 
Location of the AOC , with reference to a map of the site: Observed contamination has been documented on a 
school property , 84 occupied residential properties , and four vacant properties . Lead was detected at observed 
contamination concentrations on all 8 9 properties [see Tables 2, 3 and 4 and Sections 5.1.1.3.2.1 and 5.1.1.3.2.2 
of this HRS documentation record]. Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record shows the location of each property 
meeting the criteria for observed contamination, outlines the estimated AOC, and shows the level of contamination 
(i.e., Level II ) for each property ; Figure s 3a through 3i of this HRS documentation record provide additional detail . 
Only those properties with sampling results indicating lead levels equal to or greater than three times background 
levels are included in the HRS score [see Tables 2, 3, and 4 of this HRS documentation record] . 
As further detailed in Sample Collection and Processing Procedures for All Soil Samples below, three -to five -
point composite samples were used to document observed contamination. The AOC was delineated by creating a 
polygon connecting the outermost observed contamination samples, drawing the line through the innermost aliquot 
from each comp osite sample [see Figures 3 and 3a through 3i of this HRS documentation record] . Contamination 
is not inferred between locations of observed contamination because there are s ignificant spatial gaps between some 
of the points of observed contamination based on the number and location of observed contamination samples [see 
Figure s 3 and 3a through 3 i]. In addition, a significant contributor to the contamination w as the nonuniform use 
of pottery waste as fill material , which resulted in nonuniform distribution of contaminants [Ref. 6, pp. 8–13; 53, 
pp. 2 –852]. Redevelopment activities at properties in East Trenton since the releases ended , such as soil 
remediation, construction and reconstruction activities, and installation of community gardens and urban farms,

          could also have led to discontinuities in contaminant patterns in the intervening areas [ Refs. 49, pp. 67, 71 –72, 81; 
50, pp. 2, 5]. There are several properties in the East Trenton/Top Road area that are being addressed by the state 
or federal brownfields programs, which may include brownfields grant funding [Ref. 50, pp. 3 –5]. Properties being 
addressed under the state and federal brownfields programs are also not considered for scoring in this proposed 
listing. 
Exclusion of properties from scoring does not indicate an absence of contamination —properties excluded from 
scoring include properties with soil lead concentrations equal to or greater than the RML of 200 mg/kg but below 
three times background levels, and properties that have not yet been sampled [Ref. 36, pp. 1 –2; 53, pp. 854, 856, 
887, 888, 902, 942; see Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3 of this HRS documentation record ]. Soil removals have not 
been performed and are not scheduled for the properties scored as subject to observed contamination within the 
AOC [Ref. 51, p p. 3–4]. EPA is installing temporary , protective cover materials at the Grant Intermediate School 
as an emergency measure [Ref. 51, p. 3]. This interim action does not include removal of contaminated soil from 
the property, and the cover materials are permeable and less than 2 feet thick (i.e., topsoil, sod, and mulch) and do 
not represent a permanent cleanup solution [Ref. 51, p p. 3–4]. Surface soil samples that meet the observed 
contamination criteria were used to delineate the AOC [Ref. 1, Table 2 -3 and Section 5.1.0 ] [see Figure 3 and 
Table 4 of this HRS documentation record ]. The background soil samples and the so il samples documenting 
observed contamination were collected during EPA investigation of the site from September 2023 to January 2024 
[Ref. 22, pp. 2, 4–73]. EPA is investigating f urther delineation of lead contamination at the site, including interim 
protective actions at the school and additional residential sampling in East Trenton as requested [Ref. 6, pp. 16– 
18]. 
Sample Collection and Processing Procedures for All Soil Samples : EPA collected a ll soil samples in accordance 
with EPA -approved Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPP) dated August 2023 and November 2023; the QAPPs 
reference standard operating procedures to be followed for sample collection, processing, analysis, and validation 
as approved by EPA Region 2 Quality Assurance Officer delegates [Refs. 19, pp. 8, 15, 36–38, 40, 59 ; 20, pp. 8, 
16, 38–40, 42, 61 ; 53, p. 1 ]. To avoid any possible contamination coming from historical use of lead -based paint on 
houses, drip zones were avoided and not included in any of the composite soil samples that document observed 
contamination (EPA collected drip -zone composite samples separately at some properties) [Refs. 19, pp. 172 –174; 
20, p p. 174 –176; 53, pp. 1, 853 –954]. All soil samples w ere collected as three -to five-point composite s in 
accordance with the EPA Superfund Lead -Contaminated Residential Sites Handbook (August 2003) [ Refs. 19, pp. 
15, 44, 144; 20, pp. 16, 46, 146; 53, p. 1 ; 54, pp. 2 –3]. 
EPA collected the composite soil samples from soil borings using decontaminated, non -dedicated, stainless -steel 
hand augers ; all s oil boring locations for composite sampling at occupied properties were within 200 feet of the 
residence or school/workplace [Refs. 19, p. 15; 20, p. 16 ; 53, pp. 1, 853–954; 54]. Each three -to five-point 
composite sample consist ed of aliquots collected from the same depth interval at the five boring locations —samples 
were collected as such from depth intervals of 0 to 2 inches , 2 to 6 inches , 6 to 12 inches , 12 to 18 inches , and 18 
to 24 inches below ground surface (bgs) (i.e., five total samples w ere collected from each area sampled ) [Refs. 19, 
pp. 15, 44; 20, pp. 16, 46; 26, pp. 3 –4; 27, pp. 4 –5, 7; 28, pp. 4 –8; 29, pp. 5 –16; 30, pp. 4 –15; 31, pp. 4 –15; 54; see 
Tables 1 and 3 of this HRS documentation record ]. All the composite soil samples w ere dried , then sieved using a 
150-micrometer (μm) sieve , at the EPA Laboratory S ervices and Applied Sciences Division (LSASD) facility i n
Edison, NJ, prior to being submitted to the laboratory for analysis [Refs. 19, p. 15; 20, p. 16 ; 53, p. 1 ; 54]. The
stainless -steel hand augers and the sieves were decontaminated between samples, and r insate blank s were collecte d
regular ly throughout the sampling event to demonstrate adequate decontamination of this nondedicated samplin g
equipment [Refs. 19, pp. 15, 44; 20, pp. 16, 46; 26, pp. 3 –4; 27, pp. 4 –5, 7; 28, pp. 4 –8; 29, pp. 5 –16; 30, pp. 4 –15;
31, pp. 4 –15; 53, p. 1 ; 54]. Chain -of-custody records for the soil samples are provided in Reference s 22 and 5 5.
Laboratory Analytical Method , Data Verification/V alidation , and Reporting Limits for All Soil Samples : All 
soil samples show ing background levels or observed contamination were analyzed at the EPA Region 2 Laboratory 
in Edison, NJ , for metals, including lead, using EPA Method 200. 7 [Refs. 21, p. 3; 26, pp. 3 –4; 27, pp. 4 –5, 7; 28, 
pp. 4 –8; 29, pp. 5 –16; 30, pp. 4 –15; 31, pp. 4 –15]. These analytical results are used to identify soil samples that 
document background levels and meet the observed contamination criteria [Ref. 1, Table 2 -3; see Section 5.1.0 of 
this HRS documentation record ]. All data used to establish background levels and identify the soil samples meeting

           the observed contamination criteria were verified based on LSASD’s specifications and qualified by the Region 2 
Laboratory if the applicable quality control criteria were not met [Refs. 19, pp. 56 –59; 20, pp. 58 –61; 26, pp. 1 –2; 
27, pp. 1 –2; 28, pp. 1–2; 29, pp. 1–2; 30, pp. 1–2; 31, pp. 1–2]. The reporting limits (RL) were reported in accordance 
with method requirements; they are limits of quantitation that represent the lowest concentration at which an analyte 
can be detected in a sample and its concentration can be reported with a reasonable degree of accuracy and precision , 
and they are matrix -and dilution -dependent [Refs. 21, pp. 4, 6, 32, 40, 46 ; 52, p . 12]. This is equivalent to the HRS 
definition of sample quantitation limit ( SQL ) (i.e., the quantity of a hazardous substance that can be reasonably 
quantified give n the limits of detection for the method of analysis and sample characteristics that may affect 
quantitation (e.g., dilution, concentration) [Ref. 1, Section 1.1]. 
Background Samples – Locations and Descriptions 
As part of the EPA sa mpling efforts, EPA collected background soil samples from two properties to establish 
background levels for lead. In September 2023, EPA collected five -point composite soil samples from a public 
property along the Route 1 corridor, approximately 2 miles northeast of the documented extent of historic pottery 
locations and approximately 2.4 miles northeast of the AOC (EPA assigned ID number HP000 -P001 to this 
property); in December 2023, EPA collected five -point composite soil samples from a public park located 
approximately 0.6 mile west -northwest of the documented extent of historic pottery locations, and about 2 miles 
west-northwest of the AOC (EPA had previously collected discrete samples from this property and assigned it ID 
number HP003 -P001) [Refs. 7, p. 2; 12, p. 28; 22, pp. 4, 51 –52; see Figure 1 of this HRS documentation record] . 
The samples were collected from these site-specific background reference area s to evaluate anthropogenic ambient 
soil background conditions (i.e., hazardous substance levels that r eflect widespread impacts of nonpoint sources, 
such as historical leaded gasoline emissions) outside the impact area of the site [Ref. 24, pp. 23 -24, 33 –34, 245] . 
Location HP000 -P001 is vegetated land between developed properties along a 4 -lane roadway, and location HP003 -
P001 is a park surrounded by city streets [ see Figure s 1a and 1b of this HRS documentation record]. Both locations 
are beyond the full known extent of former pottery locations, and neither is located directly downwind of the former 
pottery locations based on the prevailing northwesterly wind direction [Ref. 6, p. 13; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 2, 39 –49; 56, 
p.5; see Figure s 1, 1a, and 1b of this HRS documentation record]. EPA did not encounter pottery waste fil l
materials (i.e., ceramic debris) in the soils at either location during the 2023 sampling activities [Ref. 53, pp. 2 –16,
843–852, 853, 951] .
The background soil samples are considered comparable to the observed contamination soil samples , as follows: 
•The background soil and observed contamination soil samples were collected from urban soils under t he
same type of environmental influences, such as traffic, roads, and anthropogenic activities [Ref. 53, pp.
854–953].
•The background soil and observed contamination soil samples were collected and processed accord ing to
the same sample collection and sieving techniques [Ref. 53, p. 1 ; 54, pp. 2 –6].
•The background soil and observed contamination soil samples were collected from specific depth interval s
spanning the top 2 feet of the soil column within the same relative timeframe [see Tables 1 and 3 of thi s
HRS documentation record] .
•The background soil and observed contamination soil samples were predominantly mixtures of clay, silt ,
sand, and/or gravel, with the predominant soil types in the background soil samples (clayey silt, silty clay ,
and sandy silt) being finer -grained than the predominant soil types in the observed contamination soi l
samples (sandy silt and silty sand) [see Tables 1 and 3 of this HRS documentation record] .
•The background soil and observed contamination soil samples were analyzed via the same analytica l
method [see above, Laboratory Analytical Method , Data Verification/V alidation , and Reportin g
Limits for All Soil Samples ].
Background soil sample identifications, locations, sample type , depths, and sampling dates are shown in Table 1 
of this HRS documentation record, and laboratory analytical results are presented in Table 2 of this HRS 
documentation record. The samples ending in “ -02” are field duplicates of the samples ending in “ -01” [Refs. 19, 
p.44; 20, p. 46] . All b ackground soil sampling locations are five-point composite samples from specific depth

(1) The RLs were reported in accordance with method requirements; they are limits of quantitation that represent the lowest concentration at
which an analyte can be detected in a sample and its concentration can be reported with a reasonable degree of accuracy and p recision, and
they are matrix -and dilution -dependent [Refs. 21, pp. 4, 6, 32, 40, 46; 52, p. 12] . This is equivalent to the HRS definition of SQL (i.e., the
quantity of a hazardous substance that can be reasonably quantified given the limits of detection for the method of analysis and sample
characteristics that may affect quantitation (e.g., dilutio n, concentration) [Ref. 1, Section 1.1] .

  (2) BOLD indicates background concentration chosen for use as the background level for each hazardous substance. L ead at 126 mg/kg in
sample 2308018 -03 is used as the background level because it is the highest lead concentration among the background samples.
(3) J = The identification of the analyte is acceptable; the reported value is an estimate with unknown bias [Ref. 31, pp. 2, 33]. For high or
unknown biased qualified background sample results, t he value presented parenthetically is the estimated maximum concentration obtained
by applying adjustment factors from the EPA fact sheet Using Qualified Data to Document and Observed Release and Observed
Contamination (November 2022) [Ref. 32, pp. 8, 20].
Additional Supporting Information for Background Levels 
As shown above, t he range of lead concentration s among the soil samples collected at the background reference 
areas is 6.42 mg/kg to 126 mg/kg . This range of lead concentrations in the samples is considered indicative of 
anthropogenic background, as a previous evaluation of available background data by EPA indicated a 5th percentile 
concentration of approximately 6 mg/kg, a 95th percentile concentration of approximately 37 mg/kg, and a 
maximum concentration of approximately 11 3 mg/kg for lead in eastern U.S. soils [Ref. 25, pp. 63, 66] . The same 
study by EPA reported a mean background concentration of 35 mg/kg for lead in the New Jersey soils subset [Ref. 
25, p. 39] . 
Contaminated Samples -Observed Contamination Locations, AOC A, Residential Soils 
Observed contamination soil sample IDs, locations, sample type , depths, and sampling dates are shown in Table 3 
of this HRS documentation record, and laboratory analytical results that meet observed contamination criteria are 
presented in Table 4 of this HRS documentation record. The samples ending in “-02” are field duplicates of the 
samples ending in “-01” [Refs. 19, p. 44; 20, p. 46]. Observed contamination soil sampling locations are three -to 
five-point composite samples from specific depth intervals spanning the top 2 feet of the soil column ; they were 
collected from the property locations shown in Figure 3 and Figures 3a through 3i of this HRS documentation 
record . As shown previously, the observed contamination soil samples were collected , processed, and analyzed 
accord ing to the same methods as the background samples and within the same relative timeframe [ see above, 
Sample Collection and Processing Procedures for All Soil Samples and Laboratory Analytical Method , Data 
Verification/V alidation , and Reporting Limits for All Soil Samples ]. Reference 22 and Reference 55 contain 
the applicable chain -of-custody records for the observed contamination soil samples [Ref. 22, pp. 5 –8, 10, 12 –19, 
21–25, 27 –47, 49, 51, 53 –56, 58 –61, 63 –64, 72 ; 55, pp. 2 –4, 7–8].

Observed Contamination Concentrations 
The observed contamination soil sample result s within AOC A are summarized in Table 4 of this HRS 
documentation record . The observed contamination samples meet the criteria for observed contamination and equal 
or exceed three times the background level [Ref. 1, Sections 2.3 and 5.1.0 ]. Section 5. 1.0 of this HRS documentation 
record describe s the sample collection , processing , and analytical methods, and defines RL. The comparison criteria 
for observed contamination are established as follows based on the b ackground lead level s in soil: 
•The highest background soil sample lead concentration was 126 mg/kg (laboratory sample ID: 2308018 -
03)[see Table 2 of this HRS documentation record]; therefore, the minimum value to establish observe d
contamination for lead is 3 x 126 = 378 mg/kg .

(1)The RLs were reported in accordance with method requirements; they are limits of quantitation that represent the lowest 
concentration at which an analyte can be detected in a sample and its concentration can be reported with a reasonable degree 
of accuracy and precision, and they are matrix-  and dilution-dependent [Refs. 21, pp. 4, 6, 32, 40, 46; 52, p. 12]. This is 
equivalent to the HRS definition of SQL (i.e., the quantity of a hazardous substance that can be reasonably quantified given the 
limits of detection for the method of analysis and sample characteristics that may affect quantitation (e.g., dilution,  
concentration) [Ref. 1, Section 1.1].

As scored for HRS purposes, the Historic Potteries site consists of the release of a hazardous substance (i.e., lead) 
from historical pottery operations resulting in an area of observed contamination that is delineated based on the 
presence of lead in the top 2 feet of soil on residential properties and school grounds [see Tables 2 and 4 and 
Figures 3 and 3a through 3i of this HRS documentation record]. Due to the history of the East Trenton/Top 
Road area, where numerous industrial-scale potteries formerly operated, EPA is investigating the pottery industry 
as the source of elevated lead levels in the area [Refs. 6, pp. 8–11; 7, pp. 2–5; 11, p. 1; 12, p. 5]. EPA identified 
more than 30 locations in and around the East Trenton/Top Road area where one or more pottery manufacturing 
businesses formerly operated [Refs. 6, pp. 8–10]. These industrial-scale potteries operated in the area over 
variable timeframes between the 1850s and the mid-20th century [Refs. 6, p. 10; 7, pp. 2–5; 8, p. 2; 9, pp. 1, 3; 37, 
p. 5; 44, pp. 1, 6–39]. In 1850, just one industrial pottery was operating in Trenton [Ref. 7, p. 4; 8, p. 2; 44, p. 37]. 
However, the industry grew increasingly prominent in the city from the 1850s until the 1920s (in 1924, more 
than 50 facilities were operating simultaneously in Trenton) , when it began to shrink considerably during the 
Great Depression [Refs. 7, pp. 4–5; 8, p. 2; 9, p. 1;  10, p. 3; 38, pp. 74–76; 44, pp. 6–42]. 
The reasons for the growth of the pottery industry in Trenton from the 1850s until the 1920s were the city’s 
central location with respect to markets (New York and Philadelphia) and its role as a hub in the regional 
transportation network of canals and railroads [Refs. 6, p. 8; 7, p. 4; 43, p. 1, 3]. The surge of industrial 
pottery development occurred primarily along the Delaware and Raritan Canal, which was built in 1834 and 
separates East Trenton and Top Road; the canal and adjacent railroad tracks provided easy delivery of raw 
materials (e.g., central New Jersey clays and eastern Pennsylvania coals) to the potteries and transport of finished 
goods from the potteries [Ref. 7, pp. 4–5; 11, p. 2; 43, pp. 1, 3–5, 7, 8; 51, p. 2]. Historical maps from 1835, 1874, 
and 1882 provide evidence of the industrial pottery development in the East Trenton/Top Road area —the 1835 
map shows the area to be significantly less developed, whereas the 1874 and 1882 maps show industrial potteries 
in clusters along the canal and adjacent railroad tracks, and individual potteries at other locations in the East 
Trenton/Top Road area [Refs. 45, p.1; 46, pp. 1–4; 47, p. 1]. Historical maps from 1930 show additional potteries 
in the area, including in the easternmost portion of the East Trenton/Top Road area [Ref. 48, pp. 2, 31–38, 50]. 
Several of the former pottery locations in the East Trenton/Top Road area are within the documented AOC, and 
most others within the East Trenton/Top Road area are clustered near the documented AOC in areas that were not 
sampled by EPA [Ref. 46, pp. 1-4; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 2-11; see Figure 2 and Section 5.1.0 of this HRS 
documentation Record]. Development of the East Trenton and Top Road residential neighborhoods coincided with 
the industrial growth as a means to support the potteries and other industries [Ref. 18, p. 5; 47, p, 1; 48, pp. 2, 31–
38, 50; 51, p. 2]. As the industry waned, some of the historical  pottery locations in the East Trenton/Top Road 
area were converted to other uses including residential [Refs. 6, pp.  10, 13; 43, p. 2; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 2, 31–38, 50].
Potteries in Trenton manufactured tableware, sanitary ware, electrical porcelain, and art ceramics [Refs. 7, p. 12; 
9, pp. 1, 3; 10, p. 2; 37, pp. 5–8; 38, pp. 74–76; 44, pp. 6–42]. Lead was used in the ceramic glazes required for 
the manufacture of many of these products, which were subject to high temperatures in the firing kilns [Refs. 7, 
pp. 6– 7, 13; 38, pp. 35–42; 39, pp. 47–52, 60–65, 72; 40, pp. 35 –36, 45–57; 41, pp. 2–3]. The number of pottery 
kilns in Trenton increased from 1 to 258 between 1852 and 1903 [Ref. 38, p. 76]. Depictions of the Trenton 
kilns show smoke emanating from their stacks and moving with the wind; lead would have been released in these 
kiln emissions and then settle into the soil downwind from the kilns [Refs. 6, pp. 9, 11; 7, p. 10; 37, p. 5; 33, p. 13; 
39, pp. 182– 198; 41, pp. 2, 3; 42, pp. 2–3; 43, p. 1]. Soil and debris containing ceramic pieces that was used as 
fill material during development of the residential neighborhoods is also adding to the lead contamination [Refs. 
6, p. 11; 11, p. 2; 53, pp. 2–852; s ee Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record] . 
During multiple sampling events from October 2020 to July 2022, EPA sampled residential properties, public 
properties, and industrial properties within the study area for the Historic Potteries site [Refs. 12, pp. 1, 12–28; 13, 
pp. 1, 13–19; 14, pp. 1, 13–21; 15, pp. 1, 13–16; 16, pp. 1, 13–17; 17, pp. 1, 14–16; 18, pp. 1, 6–9, 15–27]. During 
these sampling events, EPA found pottery sherds (i.e., ceramic chips) within the contaminated soils on many

      properties to have lead field screening levels that were above EPA RMLs [Refs. 12, pp. 68–70, 76, 81 , 87–88, 99, 
111, 115; 13, pp. 46, 55, 57, 58; 14, pp. 60, 69, 74; 15, pp. 51, 61, 62; 16, pp. 45, 50, 63; 17, pp. 48 –49, 
56–57, 59, 66 –67; 18, pp. 5 –8, 11 –12, 53 –54, 63 –64, 68, 70 –71, 74, 90 –92, 101, 117, 129, 131; 33, pp. 2 –3, 8]. 
EPA collected and analyzed some of the pottery sherds and reported lead levels up to 5,737 mg/kg [Ref. 18, pp. 6 – 
8]. EPA found that there is spatial correlation of former pottery locations and lead contamination within the AOC 
and that t he presence of lead concentrations elevated above RMLs at shallow depths is consistent with the presence 
of ceramic chips at similar depths and aerial deposition of kiln emissions from upwind historical pottery operations 
[Ref. 33, p. 18 –19]. EPA found lead to be one of the most leachable metals from the ceramic chips and that the 
isotopic composition of soil lead can be correlated to the isotopic composition of co -located ceramic chips in many 
cases , indicating that leaching of lead from the chips over time is one of the mechanisms of soil contamination [Ref. 
33, pp. 10 –13, 18 –19]. 
EPA performed additional sampling of residential properties , schools, and p arks in the Top Road and East Trenton 
neighborhoods , as well as background locations outside the historic potteries area, from in 2023 and 2024 [Ref. 22, 
pp. 2 –73; 53, pp. 1, 853 –956; 55, pp. 2 –4, 7–8; see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record] . All samples 
were c ollected within the top 2 feet of soil , and residential/school property samples were collected within 200 feet 
of the residence or school/workplace [ Ref. 54, pp. 2 -3; see Section 5.1.0 and Figures 3a through 3i of this HRS 
documentation record ]. Results for the Grant Intermediate School, where there are 542 students and 45 full -time 
faculty members , show lead concentrations more than three times above background levels in several grass -and 
soil-covered areas on school grounds [see Tables 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 of this HRS documentation record ]. The lead 
levels for the surface soil samples collected throughout the school grounds exceed the recently updated EPA 
Removal Management Level (R ML) of 200 mg/kg [Refs. 6, pp. 14 –15; 36, pp. 1 –2]. Therefore, EPA is performing 
interim actions to protect the school community from the lead contamination in the soil , including temporary 
restriction to contaminated areas until protective measures are installed (i.e., clean cover material in the main play 
areas and temporary fencing around low use areas) [Refs. 6, pp. 17 –18]. In addition to the lead contamination at the 
school, analytical results show that lead contamination more than three times above the site -specific background 
level affects 84 occupied residential properties [see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record] . EPA 
encountered evidence of pottery waste fill (i.e., ceramic debris) at 80 of the 85 properties within the documented 
AOC, including the school [see Tables 3 and 4 of this HRS documentation record]. 
As part of its 2023 -2024 sa mpling efforts, EPA collected 16 five -point composite background soil samples from a 
public property along the Route 1 corridor, approximately 2 miles northeast of the documented extent of historic 
pottery locations (EPA assigned ID number HP000 -P001 to this property) , and 11 five -point composite soil samples 
from a public park located approximately 2 miles west -northwest (EPA had previously collected discrete samples 
from this property and assigned it ID number HP003 -P001) [Refs. 7, p. 2; 12, p. 28; 22, pp. 4, 51 –52; see Figure 1 
and Table 2 of this HRS documentation record] . The samples were collected from these site-specific background 
reference area s to evaluate anthropogenic ambient soil background conditions (i.e., hazardous substance levels that 
reflect widespread impacts of nonpoint sources, such as historical leaded gasoline emissions) outside the impact 
area of the site [Ref. 24, pp. 23 -24, 33 –34, 245] . Location HP000 -P001 is vegetated land between developed 
properties along a 4 -lane roadway, and location HP003 -P001 is a park surrounded by city s treets [ Ref. 53, pp. 853, 
951; see Figure s 1a and 1b of this HRS documentation record]. Both locations are beyond the full known extent 
of former pottery locations, and neither is located directly downwind of the former pottery locations based on the 
prevailing northwesterly wind direction [Ref. 6, p. 13; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 2, 39 –49; 56, p. 5 ; see Figure s 1, 1a, and 
1b of this HRS documentation record]. EPA did not encounter pottery waste fill materials (i.e., ceramic debris) in 
the soils at either backgroun d location during the 2023 sampling activities [Ref. 53, pp. 2 –16, 843 –852, 853, 951]. 
The highest concentrations of lead reported for the background soil samples were 19.3 mg/kg (laboratory sample 
ID: 2308018 -06) and 126 mg/kg (laboratory sample ID: 2308018 -03), respectively, as shown in Table 2 of this 
HRS documentation record. The observed contamination soil samples are considered comparable to the background 
soil samples [see Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record ]. EPA encountered evidence of pottery waste fill 
(i.e., ceramic debris) at 80 of the 85 properties within the document ed AOC, including the school [see Tables 3 
and 4 of this HRS documentation record]. The AOC soil samples showed lead levels equal to or greater than three 
times the site -specific background level, as shown in Table 4 of this HRS documentation record ; this significant 
increase in concentrations over anthropogenic ambient soil background conditions is considered at least partially

  attributable to the historic potteries that operated in the East Trenton/Top Road area [Ref s. 6, p. 11; 33, pp. 1 –2, 
10–13, 18]. 
Other possible contributors to the lead contamination in the area include the historical leaded gasoline emissions, 
waste incineration, lead -based paints, aerosols, and emissions fill materials from other industrial operations 
including coal combustion, pe troleum refining, and a former solder manufacturer [Refs. 6, pp. 6 –7; 33, pp. 2, 18]. 
In addition, the historical maps form the late 19th and early 20th centuries show the emergence of other industries in 
the area , including coal, rubber, iron, and steel, which could have contributed to lead contamination [Ref. 4 6, pp. 1, 
2, 4; 47, p. 1; 48, pp. 8, 31 –38, 50]. EPA has determined that these non -CERCLA sources are not the main sources 
of lead in the area, and that the p ottery fill and airborne releases from the pottery kilns contributed significantly to 
the lead contamination [Ref. 6, p. 11]. There are several City -owned properties that are being addressed by the state 
or federal brownfields programs, which may include brownfields grant funding [Ref. 50, pp. 3 –5]. Properties being 
addressed under the state and federal brownfields programs are not included in this proposed listing. In addition, no 
individuals are documented to be living on those properties.

The total hazardous constituent quantity for AOC A could not be adequately determined according to the HRS 
requirements; that is, the total mass of all Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability 
Act (CERCLA) hazardous substances in A OC A is not known and cannot be estimated with reasonable confidence 
[Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.1 ]. Contaminant concentrations are not uniform throughout the AOC and insufficient 
historical and current data (manifests, potentially responsible party [PRP] rec ords, State records, permits, waste 
concentration data, etc.) are available to adequately calculate the total or partial mass of all CERCLA hazardous 
substances associated with AOC A. Therefore, there is insufficient information to calculate a total or par tial 
Hazardous Constituent Quantity estimate for AOC A with reasonable confidence. Scoring proceeds to the

2.4.2.1.2 Hazardous Wastestream Quantity 
The total hazardous wastestream quantity for AOC A could not be adequately determined according to the HRS

AOC A is not known and cannot be estima ted with reasonable confidence [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.2 ]. Contaminant 
concentrations are not uniform throughout the AOC and insufficient historical and current data (manifests, PRP 
records, State records, permits, waste concentration data, annual reports , etc.) are available to adequately calculate 
the total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants in AOC A. Therefore, there 
is insufficient information to adequately calculate the total or partial mass of the wastestream in the AOC. Therefore, 
there is insufficient information to evaluate the hazardous wastestream quantity for AOC A with reasonable

with reasonable confidence; therefore, it is not possible to assign a volume (Tier C) in cubic yards (yd3) for the 
AOC [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.3 ]. AOC A is assigned a value of 0 for the volume measure [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.3 ]. 
As a result, scoring proceeds to the evaluation of Tier D, Area [Ref. 1, Sec tion 2.4.2.1.4, Table 5 -2].

          5.1.1 RESIDENT POPULATION THREAT 
The resident population threat is evaluated because the AOC is within the property boundary of residences and a 
school, and within 200 feet of the respective buildings . The soil samples collected from each property were within 
200 feet of each respective residence or school [Ref. 1, Section 5.1 .1; see Figures 3 and 3a through 3i of this HRS 
documentation record ]. All the observed contamination samples summarized in Table 7 of this HRS documentation 
record are on properties with students or residents that are eligible to be scored as part of the resident population 
threat [see Section 5.1.1 of this HRS documentation record] . 
5.1.1.1 LIKELIHOOD OF EXPOSURE 
As documented in Section 5.1.0 of this HRS documentation record , observed contamination is established on 
properties with resident individuals (i.e., persons living or attending school or day care on the property and whose 
residence, school, or day care center, respectively, is on or within 200 feet of the AOC); there fore, a value of 550 
is assigned to the resident population threat likelihood of exposure factor category [Ref. 1, Sections 5.1.1 and 
5.1.1.1].

The hazardous constituent quantity for AOC A is not adequately determined. AOC A is composed of contaminated 
soil containing elevated lead concentrations , which are greater than or equal to three times the site -specific 
background levels , at a school and at 84 occupied residential p roperties [ see Tables 2, 3, and 4 of this HRS 
documentation record] . The approximate area of observed contamination on each property, excluding impervious 
surfaces, is not estimated , and contamination is not inferred between sampling points. However, the area is greater 
than 0 square feet. Per HRS Section 2.4.2.2, the hazardous waste quantity (HWQ) factor value is assigned a default

 factor value of 10 for the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway [Ref. 1, 
Section 2.4.2.2 , Table 2 -6, and Section 5.1.1.2.2 ]. 
Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value:  10 
5.1.1.2.3 Calculation of Waste Characteristics Factor Category Value 
The waste characteristics factor category value is determined by multiplying the toxicity and hazardous waste 
quantity factor values, subject to a maximum product of 1 x 108, and assigning a value from HRS Table 2 -7 based 
on the product [Ref. 1, Section 5. 1.1.2.3]. The product for the site is 1 x 105 which corresponds to a waste 
characteristics factor category value of 1 8 in HRS Table 2 -7 [Ref. 1, Table 2 -7, Section 5.1.1.2.3] . 
Toxicity Factor Value [see Table 5 of this HRS documentation record] : 10,000 
Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value [see Section 5.1.1.2.2 of this HRS documentation record] : 10 
Toxicity Factor Value × Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value: 1 x 105 
Waste Characteristics Factor Category Value: 18 
5.1.1.3 TARGETS 
The individuals whose res pective res idence , school, day care center, or workplace is both on the property and within 
200 feet of a documented AOC are included as resident population threat targets [Ref. 1, Section 5.1.1.3 ]. All Level 
II concentration properties within AOC A are occupied [see Table 7 of this HRS documentation record]. 
5.1.1.3.1 Resident Individual 
Area of Observed Contamination Letter: A 
Level of Contamination (Level I/Level II): Level II 
As presented in Section 5.1.1.3.2. 2, lead meets the criteria for Level II contaminatio n [see Figure 3 and Table 7 of 
this HRS documentation record]. Therefore, a resident individual factor value of 45 is assigned based on the Level 
II lead contamination [Ref. 1, Section 5.1.1.3.1] 
Resident Individual Factor Value: 45 
5.1.1.3. 2 Resident Population 
Resident p opulation is evaluated based on two factors, Level I concentrations and Level II concentrations [Ref. 1, 
Section 5.1.1.3.2]. 
5.1.1.3.2.1 Level I Concentrations 
As shown in Table 4 of this HRS documentation record, surface soil sample analys es for a school and 84 occupied 
residential properties indicate the presence of lead at levels meeting the HRS observed contamination criteria, but 
EPA has not designated a health -based benchmark for lead in soil for HRS purposes [Refs. 1, Table 2 -3, Table 5 -3 
and Section 5.1.0 ; 2, p. 2; see Tables 2 and 4 of this HRS documentation record]. Lead is the only hazardous 
substance scored in this HRS documentation record. Based on these considerations, t he resident population subject 
to Level I concentrations is 0. For individuals subject to Level I contamination, the appropriate factor value is 
determined by multiplying the Leve l I population by 10 [Ref. 1, Section 5.1.1.3.2.1 ], yielding a factor value of 0. 
Level I Concentrations Factor Value: 0

  5.1.1.3.2.2 Level II Concentrations 
As shown in Table 4 of this HRS documentation record, surface soil sample analys es for a school and 84 occupied 
residential properties indicate the presence of lead at levels meeting the HRS observed contamination criteria, but 
EPA has not designated a health -based benchmark for lead in soil for HRS purposes [Refs. 1, Table 2 -3, Table 5 -3 
and Section 5.1.0 ; 2, p. 2; see Tables 2 and 4 of this HRS documentation record]. All samples are located within 
AOC A [see Figure 3 and 3a through 3i of this HRS documentation record ]. When known, the actual number of 
residents is assigned as the Level II population. For each property where the actual number of residents is not 
known, the Mercer County, New Jersey persons per household value of 2. 62 is assigned [Ref. 35, p. 1] . Properties 
HP001 -P063, HP001 -P070, HP001 -P110, and HP001 -P111 are vacant residential or community properties [see 
Table 4 of this HRS Documentation Record] ; therefore, these four properties are not listed in the table below 
because there are no resident populations associated with the m.

 5.1.2 NEARBY POPULATION THREAT 
The nearby population threat was not scored . However, the nearby population threat is of concern to EPA and may 
be considered during a future evaluation. EPA identified ceramic debris and lead contamination on public 
properties , including parks that are accessible to the public during the 2023 -2024 sampling activities at the Historic 
Potteries site [Refs. 22, pp. 66–73; lab package; 31, pp. 11 –14, 210 –299; 53, pp. 512–525, 691 –756, 954–956]. 
EPA is continuing its investigation of the site , which may include sampling of additional residential and public 
properties in the Historic Potteries site area.

NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST (NPL) 
***Proposed  NPL Site***  September  2024 
CARLISLE VILLAGE CLEANERS  Albuquerque , New Mexico  
Bernalillo County  
Site Location :
Carlisle Village Cleaners site is located at 3611 Simms Avenue SE in Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico. 
The site consists of a soil gas plume centered  within the South Carlisle Shopping Village strip mall and extending into  
a mixed commercial and residential area located east of downtown Albuquerque.  
 Site History:  
The site consists of a chlorinated  solvent soil  gas plume that is centered at two former dry cleaner facilities that were 
located within a small strip mall. Together, the former dry cleaners operated from 19 53 to 2017.    
 Site Contamination/Contaminants:  
The soil gas plume consists of  tetrachloroethylene (also known as perchloroethylene [PCE]) and  trichloroethylene 
(TCE). Indoor air concentrations of PCE have been detected in both commercial and residential structures.  
 Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment : 
There are 21 occupied single -family residential structures, 80 occupied multi -family residential ground -floor subunits, 
16 occupied commercial structures, and two occupied religious institutions  in the vicinity of  the former dry cleaners  that 
have been identified as affected or potentially affected by the contamination to date . There is an estimated population of  
257 individuals that may be impacted by the contamination . 
 Response Activities (to date):  
EPA installed temporary air purifying units to the strip mall occupants in November 2022 and continues to change out 
the filters in these units as needed.  
 Need for NPL Listing: 
The state of New Mexico referred the site to the EPA because it is the most appropriate entity  to investigate the
extent of contamination and determine how to address the site. Other federal and state cleanup programs were 
evaluated but are not viable at this time because of the complexity of the site. The EPA received a letter of support for  
placing this site on the NPL from the state of New Mexico.    
[The description of the site (release) is based on information available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS. The description may 
change as additional information is gathered on the sources and extent of contamination. See 56 FR 5600, February 11, 1991, or subsequent 
FR notices.]

    HRS DOCUMENTATION RECORD 
Name of Site Carlisle Village Cleaners Date Prepared: September 2024 
EPA Region 6 
Street Address of Site*: 3611 Simms Avenue SE 
City, County, State, ZIP Code: Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New Mexico, 87108 
General Location in the State: The former Carlisle Village Cleaners (which is at the center of the Site) is 
located at 3611 Simms Avenue SE in Albuquerque, Bernalillo County, New 
Mexico, to the southeast of downtown Albuquerque within Central New Mexico 
(See HRS documentation record Figure 1 for Location Map and Ref. 3, p. 1). 
Topographic Map: The following U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 -minute series topographic 
map was used in locating the facility: Albuquerque East Quadrangle, New 
Mexico (1990) (Ref. 3, p. 1). 
Latitude: 35° 3' 49.8" North 
Longitude: 106° 36 ' 14.07 " West 
Ref: Latitude and longitude coordinates were measured from the center of the former 
facility at 3611 Simms Avenue SE and were determined using a scaled 
topographic map and Geographic Information System (GIS) software (Ref. 3, p. 
1; Ref. 64, p. 1 ). 
*The street address, coordinates, and contaminant locations presented in this HRS documentation record identify 
the general area the site is located. They represent one or more locations EPA considers to be part of the site based 
on the screening informati on EPA used to evaluate the site for NPL listing. EPA lists national priorities among the 
known "releases or threatened releases" of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely 
delineated boundaries. A site is defined as where a hazardous substance has been "deposited, stored, disposed, or 
placed, or has otherwise come to be located." Generally, HRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release 
merely represent the initial determination that a certain area may need to be address ed under CERCLA. 
Accordingly, EPA contemplates that the preliminary description of facility boundaries at the time of scoring will 
be refined as more information is developed as to where the contamination has come to be located.

  SITE SUMMARY 
Site Description 
The Carlisle Village Cleaners site (Site) is comprised of an area of regularly occupied structures (ROS) with 
documented indoor air contamination overlying soil contaminated by historic al releases of tetrachloroethene 
(PCE) from two former dry cleaners , including Carlisle Village Cleaners and L&M Laundry and Cleaners, that 
operated from the South Carlisle Shopping Village strip mall. The area of observed exposure (AOE) covers an 
estimated area of 18 acres of a predominately residential neighborhood with som e light commercial activity (Ref. 
59). The AOE include s 16 single -family residential structures, 70 multi -family residential subunits, 16 
commercial subunits, and two religious institutions ; for HRS scoring purposes this involves approximately 190 
residents and 85 workers. There are three unoccupied commercial structures ( given ROS numbers 398, 711, and 
802 for tracking purposes ) and five multi -family residential subunits located above the ground floor (subunits of 
ROS 118, 202, and 808 ) which were not included in HRS calculations (for HRS purposes, only regularly 
occupied structures are eligible for scoring; in multi -story, multi -subunit, regularly occupied structures, only 
subunits on a level with observed exposure samples and levels below are considered to be within an AOE; also, 
for multi -subunit structures inferred to be in an AOE, only regularly occupied subunits on the lowest level of the 
structure are counted as part of the AOE. [Ref. 1, Section 5.2.0]). Additionally, although subsurface soil vapor 
contamination is discussed in this HRS documentation record, an area of subsurface contamination is not scored 
for HRS purposes. (See Table 1 and Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record.) 
As shown by Site investigation history below and discussed in the Attribution section of this HRS documentation 
record, t he origin of contamination at the Site is a release, or releases, from past operations at Carlisle Village 
Cleaners and L&M Laundry and Cleaners located at 3611 and 3607 Simms Avenue SE in Albuquerque, 
Bernalillo County, New Mexico (Figure 1 of this HRS documentation record , Ref. 3, p. 1 ). An area of 
contaminated soil vapor was discovere d during the field investigation portion of an Abbreviated Preliminary 
Assessment performed by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) in May 2022. Further 
investigations at the Site identified contaminated soil vapor originating at the facilit ies (Ref. 33, pp. 19 -21; Ref. 
35, pp. 6 -7, 10 -11; Ref. 39, pp. 15, 20-21). The contamination extends for approximately 600 feet radially from 
the facilit ies (Ref. 39, p. 21; Ref. 46, pp. 3-4; Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record ). The total mass of 
contaminated soil vapor is not known. 
The contaminants of concern (COCs) at the Site and found within soil vapor contamination are PCE and its 
daughter product, trichloroethene (TCE) (Ref. 35, pp. 8 -9, 11 ). Historic al dry-cleaning operations are often the 
source of environmental releases of chlorinated solvents due to the absence of pollution prevention controls on 
historic al dry-cleaning machines or improper storage and waste disposal practices at historic al facilities (Ref. 26, 
p. 2; Ref. 27, pp. 8, 20 -21). PCE is scored for HRS purposes in t his HRS documentation record; TCE is not scored 
because it is not expected to significantly contribute to the site score. 
During the November/December 2023 subsurface characterization field event (NMED), Site geology to 105 feet 
below ground surface was characterized during the drilling and installation of two soil vapor monitor wells 
(SVMW -01 and SVMW -02). Within the first 105 feet, five hydrostratigraphic units (HSUs) were identified in the 
two soil borings and categorized as HSU 1 through HSU 5 (Ref. 33, p. 17). HSU 1 begins at the surface and is 
approximately 15 feet thick (Ref. 33, p. 18). This unit is comprised primarily of silty sand with some calcium 
carbonate cement and caliche present (Ref. 33, p. 17). HSU 2 is an approximately four -to eight -foot unit 
containing clay and silt layers (Ref. 33, p. 18). HSU 3 is approximately 60 feet thick and contains layers of fine to 
coarse sand with increasing gravel presence at the bottom of the unit (Ref. 33, p. 18). HSU 4 is a 2.5 -to 9-foot 
unit dominated by clay and silt that contains beds of gravel and sand (Ref. 33, p. 18). HSU 5 extends from the 
terminus of HSU 4 to the depth of investigation, and is at least 16 feet thick (Ref. 33, p. 19). HSU 5 is comprised 
of poorly graded sand (Ref. 33, p. 19). The subsurface characterization field event demonstrated that the

   inconsistent and thin clay and silt layers identified in HSU 2 and HSU 4 have not impeded the vertical migration 
of chlorinated solvent vapor contamination. Additionally, while moist conditions were noted in HSU 2 and HSU 
4, no evidence of saturation or pe rched groundwater was encountered during the investigation (Ref. 33, p. 25). 
The COCs, PCE and TCE, are volatile compounds which are part of a common class of chemicals with known 
vapor intrusion characteristics (Ref. 29, p. 44) . The subsurface vapors in the vadose zone may travel vertically and 
eventually enter overlying structures as a component of gas by migrating through cracks, seams, interstices, utility 
conduits, or other gaps in foundations (Ref. 29, pp. 48 -49). 
In September 2022, the EPA Removal Program began indoor air monitoring at the five buildings that comprise 
the strip mall : ROS 705 – Child Counseling Center, ROS 708 – Coffee Warehouse, ROS 799 – Coffee Office 
Space, ROS 707 – Realtor, and ROS 704 – Art St udio (Ref. 40, p. 3 ; Ref. 55, p p. 11, 12). Based on the initial 
indoor air results, the EPA Removal Program installed twelve air purifying units (APUs) across the five buildings 
in November 2022 as an interim mitigation measure to protect building occupants , and to mitigate and assess 
COC levels at the strip mall properties (Ref. 40, pp. 7-10; Ref. 55, p. 9 ). 
Site Investigation History 
The Carlisle Village Cleaners site was discovered by NMED in 2021 through a n effort to inventory all known 
historic al dry-cleaning operations in the State of New Mexico . The historic al dry cleaners, identified through a 
records review of primary sources ( e.g. city directories, Sanborn maps), were categorized by operation al duration , 
occupation status of the former facilit ies, and proximity to a sensitive population (Ref. 35, p. 11; Ref. 36, p p. 2-3). 
Former operations that appeared likely to pose a threat to human health or the environment based on meeting one 
or more priority criteria were referred to the NMED Superfund Oversight Section for investigation (Ref . 35, p . 11; 
Ref. 36, p. 4). 
In January 2022, the NMED Superfund Oversight Section completed a Pre -Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) Screen of the Site. The Pre -CERCLA Screen 
recommended a limited investigation to determine if a release of chlorinated solvents had occurred at this location 
(Ref. 35, pp. 9, 11; Ref. 37, pp. 1, 6). 
In May 2022, the NMED Superfund Oversight Section performed the field investigation recommended in the Pre -
CERCLA Screen as part of an Abbreviated Preliminary Assessment (Ref. 35, p. 10) . Four passive soil gas 
samples (PSG -01 through PSG -04) were deployed along the north and south property boundaries of the South 
Carlisle Shopping Village strip mall (Ref. 35, pp. 10, 20). PCE was detected at a maximum concentration of 
188,000 μg/m3 (PSG -04), while TCE was detected at a maximum concentration of 992 μg/m3 (PSG-04) (Ref. 3 5, 
pp. 11, 17; Ref. 38, pp. 65 , 118) . Based on the results of this investigation, NMED recommended immediate 
response by the EPA Removal Program to mitigate vapor intrusion risk for occupants of the South Carlisle 
Shopping Village strip mall and further investigation into the extent of soil vapor contamination, the potential for 
additional vapor intrusion exposure , and potential impact of the release on nearby groundwater receptors through 
a Site Inspection (Ref. 35, p. 11). 
In September 2022, the EPA Removal Program began indoor air monitoring at the five buildings that comprise 
the strip mall : Child Counseling Center, Coffee Warehouse, Coffee Office Space, Realtor, and Art Studio (Ref. 
40, p. 3 ; Ref. 55, p. 11 ). Based on the initial indoor air results, the EPA Removal Program installed twelve 
compact, stand -alone indoor APUs across the five buildings in November 2022 (Ref. 40, p p. 7-10). Additional 
indoor air monitoring events to evaluate the effectiveness of the APUs occurred in November 2022, January 2023 
(sub-slab only), February 2023, April 2023, May 2023 , and July 2023 (Ref. 40, pp. 11, 14-20; Ref. 41, pp. 5-6, 8, 
12). The maximum PCE concentration detected in indoor air at the strip mall was 3,160 μg/m3 (lab sample ID 
L1622198 -03) in May 2023, while the maximum PCE concentration detected in sub -slab soil vapor at the strip

    mall was 6,990,000 μg/m3 (lab sample ID L1578917 -03) in January 2023 (Ref. 60, pp. 143, 444 ; Ref. 61, pp. 165, 
673; Ref. 62 , p. 10; Ref. 63, p p. 4, 10). The EPA Removal Program also collected water and sludge samples from 
a separator tank connected to two floor drains within the former L&M Laundry and Cleaners (3607 Simms 
Avenue SE) (Ref. 40, pp. 8 -10). The analytical r esults identified 1.1 μg/L of PCE in water, and no PCE in the 
underlying sludge (Ref. 42, pp. 3, 5). 
To obtain a preliminary idea of the horizontal extent of vapor contamination, and to identify structures at risk of 
vapor intrusion based on soil vapor contaminant concentrations in public right -of-way, the EPA Removal 
Program conducted three passive soil gas sampling events in January, May, and June 2023 (Ref. 40, pp. 21 -26; 
Ref. 41, pp. 7 -9; Ref. 43, pp. 1,332 -1,335; Ref. 44, pp. 733 -734; Ref. 45, pp. 1,040 -1,042 ). In total, 122 passive 
soil gas samplers were installed within a 1,000 -foot radius of the Site (Ref. 43, pp. 1,332 -1,335 ; Ref. 44, pp. 733 -
734; Ref. 45, pp. 1,040 -1,042; Ref. 46, p. 4). The maximum de tected PCE concentration was 62,800 μg/m3 (Ref. 
44, p. 21). The results indicate d that the highest concentrations of PCE in soil vapor were located between the 
bounds of Carlisle Boulevard SE to the west, Thaxton Avenue SE to the south, Hermosa Dr SE to the east, and 
the alleyway just north of the strip mall to the north , correlating with a historic al release or releases at the South 
Carlisle Shopping Village strip mall . The results further indicated that the soil vapor contamination has migrated 
radially in all directions, with detectable PCE concentrations found at the 1,000 -foot boundary in most samples 
(Ref. 46, p. 4). 
In October 2023, the NMED Superfund Oversight Section performed a residential structures/sensitive population 
vapor intrusion sampling event as part of a Site Inspection. NMED collected indoor air and crawl space vapor 
samples at 18 single family and multi -family residential structures and at one daycare facility. Eighteen of the 19 
sampled structures had measurable levels of PCE in crawl space air, and all 19 sampled structures had measurable 
levels of PCE in indoor air (Ref. 8 , pp. 8-36, 2,409-2,412; Ref. 9, pp. 8 -31, 1 ,402-1,404). The maximum PCE 
concentration found within the living space of a residential structure (ROS -709-42) was 210 μg/m3, while the 
maximum PCE concentration found within a residential crawl space (ROS -709-22) was 190 μg/m3 (Ref. 8, pp. 11, 
30; Ref. 39, p. 34 ). 
In November and December of 2023, the EPA Removal Program performed a commercial structures vapor 
intrusion sampling event. EPA collected indoor air, crawl space, and sub -slab soil vapor samples at 13 structures 
(ROSs 203, 320A, 398, 704, 705, 707, 708, 799, 801, 803, 806, 901, 927) , including the five buildings that 
comprise the South Carlisle Shopping Village strip mall and two religious institution structures (Ref. 47; Ref. 48). 
All 13 sampled structures had measurable levels of PCE in indoor air (Ref. 1 2, pp. 8, 12, 771, 780, 835, 844 ; Ref. 
13, pp. 106, 111, 571, 573, 618, 621 ; Ref. 14 , pp. 7, 11, 422, 434, 471, 483 ; Ref. 15 , pp. 110, 115, 513, 516, 556, 
559; Ref. 16 , pp. 98, 102, 1648, 1658, 1722, 1733 ; Ref. 17 , pp. 98, 102, 734, 737, 746, 800, 803, 811 ). The 
maximum indoor air PCE concentration found within a structure not associated with the strip mall was 1,760 
μg/m3 in ROS 801, while the maximum sub -slab soil gas PCE concentration measured was 593,000 μg/m3 under 
ROS 801 (Ref. 13, pp. 571, 618; Ref. 20, pp. 4, 20 ; Ref. 49, p. 1,073 ). 
In November and December of 2023, NMED , through environmental services contractor I NTERA Incorporated 
(INTERA), performed subsurface characterization activities at the Site (Ref. 33, p. 13). The objective s of the 
characterization were to determine whether perched groundwater or dense non -aqueous phase liquid was present 
between ground surface and 100 feet below ground surface ; to characterize lithology; to measure contaminant 
concentrations in soil, soil vapor, and groundwater; and to install nested soil vapor monitor wells (Ref. 33, p. 7). 
No perched groundwater, DNAPL, or significant fine-grain ed confining units were identified (Ref. 33, p. 25). Soil 
samples, which were collected during boring advancement , demonstrated a maximum PCE concentration of 1.3 
mg/kg (SVMW -02) at the 80 -to-82-foot depth interval (Ref. 33, p. 39). Soil vapor samples were collected from 
multiple intervals within the two developed soil vapor monitor wells. The maximum PCE concentration detected 
in a vapor well (SVMW -01) was 7,100,000 μg/m3 at 83 feet below ground surface (Ref. 33, p. 40).

  5.0 SOIL EXPOSURE AND SUBSURFACE INTRUSION PATHWAY 
5.2 SUBSURFACE INTRUSION COMPONENT 
The origin of chlorinated solvent contamination at the Site is historic al dry-cleaning operations a t the South Carlisle 
Shopping Village strip mall. PCE became the most frequently used dry cleaning solvent beginning in the 1940s. Based on 
the operational history of each of the two dry cleaner s and the years in operation ( Carlisle Village Cleaners from 1953 to 
1975 and L&M Laundry and Cleaners from 1969 to 2017 ), it is likely that both operations used PCE as the primary dry -
cleaning solvent ( Ref. 26, pp. 1 -2; Ref. 30 ). Historic al dry-cleaning operations are often the source of environmental 
releases of chlorinated solvents due to the absence of pollution prevention controls on historic al dry-cleaning machines or 
improper storage and waste disposal practices at historic al facilities (Ref. 26, p. 2; Ref. 27, pp. 8, 20 -21). A release of PCE 
at the South Carlisle Shopping Village strip mall was confirmed based on soil vapor sampling during the May 2022 
Abbreviated Prel iminary Assessment field event (NMED) (Ref. 35 , pp. 6, 10, 11). The identification of the South Carlisle 
Shopping Village strip mall as the source of the release of PCE was further s upported by the January /May/ June 2023 
passive soil gas sampling events (EPA) ( Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record ; Ref. 39, p. 39; Ref. 46, p. 4). TCE, a 
degradation product of PCE, was also identified in soil vapor and , along with PCE , is a Site contaminant o f concern (Ref. 
32; Ref. 35, pp. 9, 10, 11, 17; Ref. 46, p. 3). 
During the NMED November/December 2023 subsurface characterization field event , Site geology to 105 feet below 
ground surface was characterized during the drilling and installation of two soil vapor monitor wells (SVMW -01 and 
SVMW -02). Within the first 105 feet, five hydro stratigraphic units (HSUs) were identified in the two soil borings and 
categorized as HSU 1 through HSU 5 (Ref. 33, p. 17) . HSU 1 begins at the surface and is approximately 15 feet thick 
(Ref. 33, p. 18) . This unit is comprised primarily of silt y sand with some calcium carbonate cement and caliche present 
(Ref. 33, p. 1 7). HSU 2 is an approximately four -to eight -foot unit containing clay and silt layers (Ref. 33, p. 18) . HSU 3 
is approximately 60 feet thick and contains layers of fine to coarse sand with increasing gravel presence at the bottom of 
the unit (Ref. 33, p. 18). HSU 4 is a 2.5 -to 9-foot unit dominated by clay and silt that contai ns beds of gravel and sand 
(Ref. 33, p. 18). HSU 5 extends from the terminu s of HSU 4 to the depth of investigation, and is at least 16 feet thick (Ref. 
33, p. 19). HSU 5 is comprised of poorly graded sand (Ref. 33, p. 19). The subsurface characterization field event 
demonstrated that the inconsistent and thin clay and silt layers identified in HSU 2 and HSU 4 have not impeded the 
vertical migration of chlorinated solvent vapor contamination. Additionally, while moist conditions were noted in HSU 2 
and HSU 4, no evidence of saturation or perched groundwater was encountered during the investigation (Ref. 33, p. 25). 
PCE and TCE belong to a class of chemicals with known vapor intrusion characteristics (Ref. 29, p. 44). The subsurface 
source of vapor -forming chemicals, which has so far been identified as a soil vapor contamination within the vadose zone , 
has migrated radially in all directions from the strip mall via gaseous diffusion through coarse -grained geologic materials 
as demonstrated by the January/May/June 2023 passive soil gas sampling events (EPA) (Ref. 29, pp. 41, 46 ; Ref. 33, pp. 
17-19; Ref. 46, pp. 3-4). Additionally, d uring the November/December 2023 subsurface characterization field event 
(NMED), active soi l vapor samples from two Site soil vapor monitor wells (SVMW -01 and SVMW -02) have 
demonstrated PCE concentrations in the vadose zone ranging from 230,000 µg/m3 to 7,100,000 µg/m3 between four feet 
and 91 feet below ground surface (Ref. 33, p. 40) . Hazardous vapors in the vadose zone can enter overlying structures as a 
component of gas by migrating through cracks, seams, interstices, utility conduits, or other gaps in foundations (Ref. 29, 
pp. 48 -49). The area overlying the known boundaries of the so il vapor contamination consists of a dense array of single 
family and multi -family residential neighbor hoods with some light commercial activity in the near Site vicinity. 
Residential structures in this area are constructed with an underlying crawlspace wi thout a radon or vapor mitigation 
system, and commercial structures are constructed with a slab -on-grade foundation (Ref. 31; Ref. 46, p. 4; Ref. 65). Based 
on tax assessor records, the residential structures surrounding the Site were primarily built between 1946 and 1951 with 
underlying crawlspaces (Ref. 4, pp. 1 -3).

  5.2.0 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
There is one identified area of observed exposure (AOE), or area containing structures with indoor air contamination due 
to subsurface intrusion, at the Site as shown in Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record . There is also documented 
subsurface contamination underlying the AOE (Ref. 46, pp. 3-4). However, an area of subsurface contamination (ASC) 
was not evaluated in this HRS documentation record because it is not expected to significantly contribute to the overall 
Site score.

Location, description , and delineation of AOE ( see Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record ): 
There are 16 regularly occupied single -family residential structures, 70 regularly occupied multi -family residential 
ground -floor subunits, 16 regularly occupied commercial structures, and two regularly occupied religious institutions 
within the area of AOE 1. There are three unoccupied commercial structures ( given ROS numbers 398, 711, and 802 for 
tracking purposes ), and five multi -family residential subunits located above the ground floor (subunits of ROS 118, 202, 
and 808), which were not included in HRS calculations (for HRS purposes, only regularly occupied structures are eligible 
for scoring; in multi -story, multi -subunit, regularly occupied structures, only subunits on a level with observed exposure 
samples and levels below are considered to be within an AOE; also , for multi -subunit structures inferred to be in an AOE, 
only regularly occupied subunits on the lowest level of the structure are counted as part of the AOE. [Ref. 1, Se ction 
5.2.0]) . Although ROS 398 was not scored because it was vacant, it exhibited PCE concentrations that would meet 
observed exposure criteria and exceeded the cancer risk screening concentration benchmark. The boundaries of AOE 1 
were determined by establishing observed exposure to PCE through indoor air sampling at 33 regularly occupied 
structures or subunits (see observed exposure information in Tables 5 and 6 below of this HRS documentation record ). An 
additional 71 regularly occupied structures or subunits have inferred contamination based on their location between 
structures with observed contamination (see inferred structures identified in Table 20 below of this HRS documentation 
record ) (Ref. 4, p. 1 -3; Figure 2 and Table 1 of this HRS documentation record ). All structures are located within a 600-
foot radius of the location of the former dry cleaners (Ref. 39, p. 21; Ref. 46, pp. 3-4; Figure 2 of this HRS documentation 
record ). In Table 1, each structure is identi fied by a number, and scored subunits associated with a structure are identified 
by a letter appended to the ROS number.

   Observed Exposure by Chemical Analysis 
Indoor air monitoring at the Site began in September 2022 (Ref. 40, p. 3) . Together, EPA -led and NMED -led field 
investigations have resulted in the collection of indoor air samples at 11 single -family residential structures , 11 multi -
family subunits, 12 commercial structures , and two reli gious institution structur es. Residential samples were collected 
over a 24 -hour period, while commercial samples were collected over an 8 -hour period. The exception was ROS 305 
which is a residential structure operating as a commercial business, so samples were collected as a residential structure. 
Samples were collected using individually certified evacuated canisters equipped with flow controllers. All samples were 
analyzed by EPA Method Toxic Organics -15 Low Level ( Ref. 6, p. 12; Ref. 7, p p. 6-7, 21, 23 ; Ref. 8, p. 6; Ref. 9, p. 6; 
Ref. 12, p. 906; Ref. 13, p. 6 89; Ref. 14, p. 539; Ref. 15, p. 636; Ref. 16, p. 1 ,792; Ref. 17, p. 873 ; Ref. 47, p. 8; Ref. 48, 
pp. 6-7; Ref. 54, pp. 1 -3; Ref. 55, pp. 11 -12). 
All but one structure (ROS 305 , background sample location) of the 36 sampled structures measured indoor air 
concentrations of PCE above the laboratory reporting limit . Twenty -four of the structures measured indoor air 
concentrations above the HRS cancer risk subsurface intrusion component benchmark of 1.08E -02 mg/m3 (equivalent to 
10.8 µg/m3) (Ref. 2, p. 2). 
Establishment of Background Levels 
To document that indoor air contamination levels are significantly above background levels, an indoor air sample was 
collected that established a background concentration for affected structures. The background indoor air sample was 
collected from ROS 305 during the October 2023 Site Inspection sampling event (NMED) using an individually certified 
evacuated canister equipped with a 24 -hour flow controller. The sample was analyzed by EPA Method Toxic Organics -15 
Low Level (Ref. 9, p. 30). ROS 305 is located at the edge of the known boundary of the soil vapor contamination 
exhibited by passive soil gas sampling (Ref. 46, p. 4; Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record ). Of the 37 sub -slab or 
crawlspace samples collected , the crawlspace sample from ROS 305 is the one sample result below detection limits for 
PCE (Ref. 9, p. 31; Ref. 11 , pp. 2 -3). 
ROS 305 is similar in construction to other residential structures in the Site vicinity , with all sampled residential structures 
being constructed with wood -frame, cinder block, or stucco with a crawl space (Ref. 31 , pp. 1 -2, 7-8, 13 -14, 19 -20, 25 -26, 
31-32, 37 -38, 43 -44, 49 -50, 55 -56, 61 -62, 67 -68, 73 -74, 79 -80, 85 -86, 91 -92, 97 -98, 103 -104, 109 -110). One commerci al
structure, 320A, was converted from a residential structure and is similar in construction to the residential structures in t he
Site vicinity with a crawlspace. All other commercial sampled structures were built with a slab -on-grade foundation (Ref .
65, pp. 1 -2, 9, 18-19, 26 -27, 34 -35, 42 -43, 50 -51, 74 -75, 82-83, 95 -96). A specific commercial structure was not select ed
for background comparison because all commercial structures in the immediate Site vicinity are within the AOE and ar e
situated above the area of soil vapor contamination, as exhibited by passive soil gas sampling (Figure s 2 and 3 of thi s
HRS documentation record and Ref. 46, p. 4).

   J -Result is less than the reporting limit but greater than or equal to the method detection limit and the concentration is an 
approximate value ; no bias is associated with this result (Ref. 9, p. 5 ; Ref. 11, p. 5 ). Per the 2022 EPA fact sheet, Using 
Qualified Data to Document an Observed Release and Observed Contamination , results qualified J solely due to detection 
at or above the detection limit but below the quantitation limit are not considered to be biased, and are therefore do not 
require adjustment (Ref. 21, pp. 5, 6, 8). 
Laboratory r eporting limits are adjusted for sample size, dilution, and matrix interference ( Ref. 9, p. 5, 6, 31; Ref. 11, p. 5) 
and are equivalent to sample quantitation limits (SQL) as defined in HRS Section 1.1, Definitions. 
Background Levels 
The background level for PCE for establishing observed exposure has been selected to be 0. 44 μg/m3. PCE is a man -made 
substance, and no other sources of PCE are known to be in the immediate Site vicinity (Ref. 50). Prior to the October 
2023 Site Inspection sampling event , NMED requested that property occupants remove anthropogenic sources of 
chlorinated solvents that could interfere with the air sample results (Ref. 39, p. 14) . 
The detection limit for the background sample is identified as the reporting limit, which is defined for this analysis as the 
lowest concentration at which an analyte can be reliably measured and reported without qualification. The reporting limit 
is adjus ted for sample size, dilution, and matrix interference (Ref. 9, p p. 5, 6, 31; Ref. 11, p. 5 ). This definition is the same 
as the HRS definition for Sample Qua ntitation Limit (SQL) , which is the quantity of a substance that can be reasonably 
quantified give n the limits of detection for the methods of analysis and sample characteristics that may affect quantitation 
(for example: dilution, concentratio n) (Ref. 1, Section 1.1). The terms can be used interchangeably in this context. 
The background sample and residential observed exposure samples were collected during the same sampling event, by the 
same sampling team, using the same sampling technique and over a similar, approximately 24 -hour period (see Figure 2 
of this HRS documentation record for background location). The commercial and religious structures observed exposure 
samples were collected approximately one month later using the same sampling technique over a similar, approximately 
8-hour period.

J -Result is less than the reporting limit but greater than or equal to the method detection limit and the concentration is an 
approximate value (Ref. 9, p. 5). 
Exposure Samples 
Indoor air concentrations of PCE greater than or equal to three times the background level of 0.44 micrograms per cubic 
meter (μg/m3), an observed release criterion of 1.32 μg/m3, and attributable to Site subsurface contamination establish an 
observed exposure (Ref. 1, Table 2 -3). 
During the October 2023 Site Inspection sampling event (NMED) , ambient, backgrou nd, indoor, and sub -structure air 
samples were collected over a 24 -hour period. During the November /December 2023 commercial vapor intrusion 
sampling event (EPA) , ambient, indoor, and sub -structure air samples were collected over an 8 -hour period. Both 
sampling events used individually certified evacuated canisters equipped with flow controllers . All samples were analyzed 
by EPA Method Toxic Organics -15 Low Level (Ref. 8, p. 6; Ref. 9, p. 6; Ref. 12, p. 906 ; Ref. 13, p. 6 89; Ref. 14, p. 539; 
Ref. 15, p. 636; Ref. 16, p. 1,792; Ref. 17, p. 873).

 Attribution to Subsurface and Facilit ies 
Association of Release s of PCE with Historic al Dry Cleaner Operations 
Historic al dry-cleaning operations are often the source of environmental releases of chlorinated solvents due to the 
absence of pollution prevention control s on historic al dry-cleaning machines or improper storage and waste disposal 
practices at historic al facilities (Ref. 26, p. 2 ; Ref. 27, pp. 8, 20- 21). Two historic al dry cleaners operated at the South 
Carlisle Shopping Village strip mall. According to Albuquerque city directory records , Carlisle Village Cleaners operated 
as a dry cleaner at 3611 Simms Avenue SE from 1953 to 1975 (Ref. 30, pp. 1- 3, 10- 11). L&M Laundry and Cleaners 
operated as a dry cleaner at 3607 Simms Avenue SE from 196 9 to 2017 (Ref. 30, pp. 8- 9, 15- 17). 
Before the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act was promulgated in November 1980, there was little regulation or 
oversight over hazardous wastes generated at dry cleaning operations (Ref. 27, p. 16) . During the operational period of the 
two historic al dry cleaners (Carlisle Village Cleaners from 1953 to 1975 and L&M Laundry and Cleaners from 1969 to 
2017) , dry-cleaning machine technology was still evolving (Ref. 26, p. 2). Between the 1920s and 1960s, “first -generation 
machines”, also known as transfer machines , were the mos t common dry-cleaning machine in use (Ref. 27, p p. 6, 7). 
Because first -generation machines required the operator to manually transfer garments between the washer and tumbler, 
solvent vapor release was common (Ref. 27, p. 6). “Second -generation machines”, also known as vented dry -to-dry 
machines, allowed for garments to be cleaned in a single machine (Ref. 27, p. 7 ). By the time third -generation, or closed -
loop machines , were introduced in the late 1970s, more dry -cleaning machines were equipped with early pollution 
prevention controls , including carbon adsorption units and refrigerated condensers to recover solvent from vapors (Ref. 
27, p. 7 -8). In addition, first -and second -generation dry -cleaning machines had low “solvent mileage” and required much 
higher quantities of PCE to clean a unit of clothing than machines introduced later (Ref. 26, p. 2; Ref. 27, p. 8). 
Besides machine limitations and poor housekeeping practices, the relatively high vapor pressure and vapor density of PCE 
can cause PCE vapors to emanate from storage containers in indoor, confined spaces and, w ith restricted air flow, the 
dense PCE vapors can penetrate concrete flooring and enter the upper vadose zone to form a “vapor cloud” (Ref. 66, p. 1). 
Continued density -derived pressure can move PCE vapors further into the subsurface to where gaseous diffusion begins to 
control the movement of subsurface vapors (Ref. 66, p. 1). “Vapor clouds” reaching tens of feet into the upper vadose 
zone have been documented without corresponding soil contamination (Ref. 66, p. 1). Dry cleaners are a known 
commercial operation susceptible to this contaminant transport m echanism (Ref. 66, p. 1). 
It is estimated that in 1962, when PCE became the preferred solvent in dry -cleaning operations in the United States , 
approximately 90% of PCE consumed was by the dry -cleaning industry (Ref. 28, p. 3). In 1990, approximately 50% of the 
PCE consumed in the United States was by the dry -cleaning and textile processing industry (Ref. 28, p. 5 ). 
Evidence of PCE Migration from the South Carlisle Shopping Village Strip Mall to Below Contaminated Structures 
During the January/May/June 2023 passive soil gas sampling events (EPA), 122 passive soil gas samplers were deployed 
within a 1,000 -foot radius of the strip mall to provide an initial evaluation of the horizontal extent of the soil vapor 
contamination (Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record ; Ref. 40, pp. 21 -26; Ref. 41, pp. 7 -9; Ref. 43, pp. 1,332 -1,335; 
Ref. 44, pp. 733 -734; Ref. 45, pp. 1,040 -1,042; Ref. 46, p. 4). The results indicated that the highest concentrations of PCE 
in soil vapor were located between the bounds of Carlisle Boulevard SE to the west, Thaxton Avenue SE to the south, 
Hermosa Dr SE to the east, and the alleyway just north of the strip mall to the north, correlating with a historical release or 
releases at the South Carlisle Shopping Village st rip mall. The results further indicated that the soil vapor contamination 
has migrated radially in all directions , with detectable PCE concentrations found at the 1,000 -foot boundary in most 
samples (Ref. 39, pp. 39 -40; Ref. 46, p. 4). The November/December 2023 subsurface characterization event (NMED) 
confirmed that the first 10 5 feet of the Site subsurface consists mostly of sand units, with thin and intermittent fine -
grained units present in two hydrostratigraphic units (Ref. 33, pp. 13, 17 -19). The coarse -grained geologic materials allow 
subsurface vapor to migrate radially in all directions via gaseous diffusion (Ref. 29, p. 46 ; Ref. 33, pp. 17 -19). 
Additionally, there are 37 sub -slab or crawlspace samples corresponding to 27 sampled structures. Of these, 36 sample 
results exhibited PCE detections for 26 corresponding structures, with the highest detections occurring in sub -slab

    samples. For both sub -slab samples and crawlspace samples, structures closer to the strip mall generally exhibited higher 
detections of PCE. The one sample result below detection limits for PCE was collected from the crawlspace beneath ROS 
305, the structu re from which a background indoor air sample was collected, and located at the edge of the known 
boundary of the soil vapor contamination (Ref. 8, pp. 8 -15, 18, 24; Ref. 9, pp. 8, 9, 12 -17, 27 -29, 31; Ref. 10; Ref. 11; 
Ref. 12, p. 777; Ref. 19, p. 16; Ref. 49, pp. 11, 15, 19, 22, 26, 30; Ref. 67, pp. 11, 16, 21, 26; Ref. 68, pp. 9, 13, 17, 21; 
Ref. 69, pp. 9, 14, 19, 24; Ref. 70, pp. 8, 12, 16, 20; Ref. 71, pp. 8, 12, 16, 19, 23, 27 ; Figure 3 of this HRS documentation 
record ). 
The pattern of subsurface contamination points to both former dry cleaners collectively as the origin of contamination. It 
is not possible to determine which facility the contamination originated at due to the proximity of the former facilities, the 
comingling of contamination over time, the lack of records concerning historic spills or releases, and the amount of time 
that has elapsed since the release, or releases, took place. 
Lack of Structural Containment Permanently Preventing Vapor Intrusion 
Hazardous vapors in the vadose zone can enter overlying structures as a component of gas by migrating through cracks, 
seams, interstices, utility conduits, or other gaps in foundations (Ref. 29, pp. 48 -49). During the NMED October 2023 Site 
Inspection sampling event, it was noted that all sampled residential structures were wood -frame , cinder block , or stucco 
structures with crawl spaces (Ref. 31). None of the sampled residential structures had radon mitigation or vapor or 
moisture barriers in place (Ref. 31) . During November/December 2023 commercial vapor intrusion sampling event 
(EPA), the sampled commercial structures were recorded as wood -frame, cinder block, stucco, or brick structures (Ref. 
65). All but one commercial sampled structure (ROS -320A , built over a crawl space ) was constructed with a slab -on-
grade foundation (Ref. 65 , p. 9 ). None of the commercial sampled structures were equipped with a radon mitigation or 
sub-slab vapor or moisture barrier . The five commercial sampled structures that comprise the South Carlisle Shopping 
Village strip mall (ROS 705 – Child Counseling Center, ROS 708 – Coffee Warehouse, ROS 799 – Coffee Office Space, 
ROS 707 – Realtor, and ROS 704 – Art Studio ) have been provide d with indoor air purifying units ; however , although 
such units reduce contaminant concentrations in indoor air, they do not prevent initial intrusion of vapors into structures 
(Ref. 40, pp. 7-10; Ref. 65). Based on tax assessor records, the residential neighborhood within A OE 1 was primarily built 
between 1946 and 1951 while the sampled commercial structures were built between 1949 and 1975 (Ref. 4 , pp. 1 -3). 
Consideration of Anthropogenic Sources 
One week prior to the October 2023 Site Inspection sampling event (NMED) , NMED field personnel visited with each 
property owner or occupant to discuss preparing the structure for the sampling event (Ref. 7, pp. 2-10; Ref. 31). NMED 
requested that potential anthropogenic sources of the Site contaminants of concern be temporarily relocated to an outdoor 
shed, sealed -off garage, or other location prior to the indoor air sampling event to minimize the influence of 
anthropogenic sources on indoor air quality (Ref. 7, pp. 2-10; Ref. 39, p. 14 ). 
In November 2023, the EPA Removal Program conducted building surveys for commercial structures to be sampled and 
visited with property owners prior to collecting indoor air samples. EPA identified and assisted with relocating potential 
anthropogenic sources prior to indoor air sampling (Ref. 48, pp. 6, 8-9; Ref. 55 pp. 14 -15; Ref. 65, pp. 1, 6, 10, 15, 18, 23, 
26, 31, 34, 39, 42, 47, 50, 55, 58, 63, 66, 71, 74, 79, 82, 87, 95, 100). 
Four structures or subunits, ROS 221, 702F, 801, and 901, still had chemicals that potentially contained VOCs present 
within the structure during indoor air sampling . The cleaning chemicals present within ROS 801 were kept in a closet that 
remained closed during sampling (Ref. 31 , pp. 49, 109, 114; Ref. 47, p. 13 ; Ref. 48, p. 9; Ref. 65, pp. 58, 63, 82, 87). Four 
indoor air samples (L2370885 -01 through L23 70885 -04) were collected from various locations in ROS 801 and exhibited 
similar concentrations of PCE (Ref. 13, pp. 2, 10, 14, 18, 22; Ref. 20, pp. 8, 12, 16, 20; Ref. 65, p. 58, 65). Samples 
collected from subunits nearby to ROS 702F in the same apartment complex exhibited similar concentrations of PCE 
(Ref. 8, pp. 25, 31, 34, 35, 36; Ref. 9, p. 24 ). All four structures or subunits have corresponding sub -slab or crawlspace 
samples that exhibited detecti ons of PCE , with significantly higher concentrations detected beneath ROS 801 and 901 
(which have slab -on-grade foundations) compared to indoor air samples (Ref. 8, p p. 8, 18; Ref. 49, pp. 15, 19, 22, 26).

   Additionally, passive soil gas sampling indicates that all four structures or subunits are located above the area of PCE-
contaminated soil vapor (Ref. 46, p. 4). This indicates the primary pathway of PCE contamination appears to be from soil 
vapor contamination below the structures or subunits, and it is unlikely that potentially -VOC -containing chemicals 
significantly contributed to the indoor air PCE concentrations in these sampled structures or subunits . 
Consideration of Ambient Air Contamination 
Outdoor, ambient air sampling was conducted during each day of indoor air sampling activities during the October 2023 
Site Inspection sampling event (NMED) and November/December 2023 Integrated Assessment sampling event (EPA) to 
characterize background, am bient air quality in the Site vicinity and to assess the influence of potential ambient air 
contamination on indoor air quality. Four ambient air samples were collected during the October 2023 Site Inspection 
sampling event (NMED). The analytical results i dentified trace concentrations of PCE in three samples (ROS -221-11 
[0.28  μg/m3], ROS -314-11 [0.33 μg/m3], and ROS -317-11 [0.37 μg/m3], all J -flagged) and one PCE concentration of 1.7 
μg/m3 in ROS -701-11 (Ref. 8, p. 26; Ref. 9, pp. 11, 21, 26). Two ambient air samples (Lab ID: L2371216 -02 and 
L2371216 -03) were collected during the November/December Integrated Assessment sampling event (EPA). The 
analytical results identified ambient air PCE concentrations of 1.34 μg/m3 (J-flagged) and 2.10 μg/m3 (Ref. 14, p. 474, 
477). 
There are 37 sub-slab or crawlspace samples corresponding to 27 sampled structures. Of these, 36 sample results 
exhibited PCE detections for 26 corresponding structures, with the highest detections occurring in sub -slab samples. For 
both sub -slab samples and crawlspace samples, structures closer to the strip mall generally exhibited higher detections of 
PCE. The one sample result below detection limits for PCE was collected from the crawlspace beneath ROS 305, the 
structure from which a background indoor ai r sample was collected, and located at the edge of the known boundary of the 
soil vapor contamination (Ref. 8, pp. 8 -15, 18, 24; Ref. 9, pp. 8, 9, 12 -17, 27 -29, 31 ; Ref. 10; Ref. 11; Ref. 12, p. 777; Ref. 
19, p. 16; Ref. 49, pp. 11, 15, 19, 22, 26, 30; Ref. 67, pp. 11, 16, 21, 26; Ref. 68, pp. 9, 13, 17, 21; Ref. 69, pp. 9, 14, 19, 
24; Ref. 70, pp. 8, 12, 16, 20; Ref. 71, pp. 8, 12, 16, 19, 23, 27 ; Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record ). This matches 
the pattern of PCE contamination exhibited by the pas sive soil gas sampling (Ref. 46, p. 4). Additionally, as shown in 
Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record, many of the soil gas and sub -slab samples exhibited very elevated 
concentrations in the subsurface throughout the AOE (points showing levels at or above 1,000 μg/m3 are found throughout 
the AOE). This indicates the primary pathway of PCE contamination appears to be from soil vapor contamination below 
the structures or subunits, and it is unlikely that outdoor air is significantly contributing to the elevated levels of indoor air 
PCE concen trations seen at the Site.

Consideration of Other Possible Sources of PCE 
In 2021, NMED catalogued all historic al dry cleaning, laundry, and laundry supply business in the Albuquerque 
metropolitan area by examining City di rectory records (Ref. 36). The listed businesses were plotted on Google Earth and 
the locations o f the listed businesses were compared to the extent of known subsurface PCE contamination (Ref. 51). Five 
inventoried dry cleaners or laundries, including Carlisle Village Cleaners and L&M Laundry and Cleaners, are located 
above the extent of subsurface PCE contamination identified in the January/May/June 2023 passive soil gas sampling 
events (EPA) (Ref. 46, p. 4 ; Ref. 51 ). The three additional businesses include Village Laundry , which was listed as a

   -laundry at 3607 Simms Avenue SE from approximately 1962 to 1968 (Ref. 30, pp. 4 -7), Day and Night 
Laundry/Twentieth Century Laundry, which was listed as a self -serve laundry at 1116 Carlisle Boulevard SE from 
approximately 1962 to 1982 , and Rockefeller’s Cleaners Company, which was listed as a cleaner or dyer at 1104 Hermosa 
Drive SE from 1986 through 1990 and is also a known satellite location of the present day Rockefeller’s Cleaning 
Company (Ref. 34, p. 9 ; Ref. 52; Ref. 53). It is unlikely that any of the three listed businesses operated as dry cleaners 
based on the City directory records , and therefore unlikely that any of the three businesses used PCE in large enough 
quantities to substantially contribute to the identified contamination. 
A search for other possible sources of PCE contamination located within a half -mile of the Site did not identify any 
facilities within EPA’s Envirofacts Database (Ref. 50). In addition, the contaminants being scored in this HRS 
documentation record are man -made substances not found naturally in the environment. 
Structure Containment 
As presented above in the AOE, there are 21 residential , 10 commercial , and 2 religious regularly occupied structures or 
subunits that have observed exposure documented through chemical analysis and are therefore assigned a containment 
value of 10 (Ref. 1, Table 5 -12). Consistent with HRS Section 5.2.1.1.2.1, for all the regularly occupied structures with 
unknown containment features , a structure containment value of greater than zero is assigned.

           Tier C – Volume: 
There are 102 residential and/or commercial structures or subunits within AOE -1 (Ref. 4, pp. 1-3; Figure 2 of this HRS 
documentation record). There are five multi -family residential subunits located above the ground floor (subunits of ROS 
118, 202, and 808), which were not included in HRS calculations (for HRS purposes, in multi -story, multi -subunit, 
regularly occupied structures, only subunits on a level with observed exposure samples and levels below are considered to 
be within an AOE; also, for multi -subunit structures inferred to be in an AOE, only regularly occupied subunits on the 
lowest level of the structure are counted as part of the AOE. [Ref. 1, Section 5.2.0]) . The area of each occupied residential 
and comm ercial structure , as a whole, is shown in square feet (ft2) in the tax database (Ref. 4) and in records of 
conversations with property owners (Ref. 5 ; Ref. 56 ; Ref. 57). Since the height of each structure is unknown and not 
readily available, according to Section 5.2.1 .2.2 of the HRS, a ceiling height of 8 feet was used to calculate volume. The 
product was divided by 27 to convert the volume to cubic yards (yd3). Calculations for AOE 1 are as follows:

5.2.1.1.1 Observed Exposure 
Observed exposure to PCE was documented in Section 5.2.0 and the AOE 1 discussion of this HRS documentation 
record. AOE 1 was identified based on 33 structures or subunits which had observed exposure concentrations of PCE 
obtained through indoor air sampling (Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record ). 
Chemical Analysis 
Of the 3 3 structures or subunits that had observed exposure concentrations of PCE, 23 regularly occupied residential or 
commercial structures or subunits had indoor air concentrations of PCE above the PCE cancer -risk benchmark. These 
structures are tabulated below .

5.2.1.3.2 Population 
For residential structures or subunits, the number of tenants is recorded where available from building surveys (Ref. 31) . 
For the remaining residential structures or subunits, t he actual population count was not readily available, therefore the 
persons per residence for the county in which the residence is located was used (Ref. 1, Section 5.2.1.3.2). Based on the 
United States Census Bureau, there are 2.37 persons per household in Bernalillo County, in which the city of Albuquerque 
is located (Ref. 18, p. 2). Population within an area of subsurface contamination is not considered for this scoring 
evaluation.

NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST (NPL) 
***Proposed NPL Site***  September 2024 
EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES - VERNON Vernon, California 
Los Angeles County  
Site Location:
The
 former Exide Technologies – Vernon site (site) is located at 2700 South Indiana Street in the city of Vernon, Los 
Angeles County, California. The site is situated within an industrial area. The city of Los Angeles is approximately five 
miles northwest of the site. 
 Site History: 
The Exide facility began lead recycling operations in 1922. By 1982, the facility was conducting battery recycling and 
lead-refining operations where lead-acid batteries were crushed and recycled in a secondary lead smelter system at the 
site. Exide operations were terminated in March 201 4. Since 2013, the California Department of Toxic Substances 
Control (DTSC) has conducted extensive site characterization activities at the site and surrounding areas, including on-
site sampling, off-site sampling, and excavations of residential yards. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy was settled in 2020. 
Site Contamination/Contaminants:  
Ground water beneath the site is contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE). Three wells considered downgradient from 
the site
 have exhibited historical maximum TCE concentrations above the EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Act Maximum 
Contaminant Level. In addition, lead contamination in soils has been found in the on-site acid pits as well as in the 
residential neighborhoods around the site. 
 Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment: 
TCE is the contaminant of concern and known to be prevalent in area ground water. Residential populations 
potentially served by impacted drinking water wells range from 133,756 to 459,370 individuals.  
 Response Activities (to date):  
In 2018, the state began clean-up of soil at residential properties and more than 5,000 properties have been excavated . 
Since October 2021, the EPA and the DTSC have worked to oversee the actions at the site. Activities completed include 
decontaminating and tearing down remaining on-site lead battery processing and smelting buildings and assessing on-
site soil contamination.  
 Need for NPL Listing: 
The state of California referred the site to the EPA for NPL listing to avoid interruptions in site cleanup . TCE 
contamination in site groundwater likely is a contributor to area wide TCE contamination found in the Los Angeles 
Basin. Other federal and state cleanup programs were evaluated but are not viable at this time. The EPA received a letter 
of support for placing the site on the NPL from the state of California.  
[The description of the site (release) is based on information available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS. The description may 
change as additional information is gathered on the sources and extent of contamination. See 56 FR 5600, February 11, 1991, or subsequent 
FR notices.] 
For more information about the hazardous substances identified in this narrative summary, including general information regarding the effects of exposure to 
these substances on human health, please see the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) ToxFAQs. ATSDR ToxFAQs  can be found on 
the Internet at https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/index.asp or by telephone at 1-800-CDC-INFO or 1-800-232-4636.

Pathways, Components, or Threats Not Scored 
HRS Scoring for the former Exide Technologies – Vernon facility was limited to the groundwater 
migration pathway and was sufficient to qualify for the NPL solely based on the groundwater 
migration pathway score. 
The soil exposure and subsurface intrusion, surface water, and air pathways were evaluated as part 
of the Site Inspection (SI), there was not sufficient data or documentation to significantly impact 
the HRS Score based on the following factors: 
Soil Exposure Component of the Soil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion Pathway: Historical 
operations at the former Exide -Vernon facility may have resulted in lead and other heavy metals 
being emitted and deposited to the ground and on other surfaces around the facility and in 
surrounding areas (Ref. 7, p.52). The facility is currently undergoing closure activities, is 
surrounded by a fence, and is entirely paved, preventing any residual on -site soil contamination 
from being released into the environment, a nd there is no public recreation use (Ref. 7, p.52). 
While there is an estimated population of 6,055 within one mile of the Exide -Vernon facility, there 
are no residents within 0.5 miles of the facility (Ref. 7, p.52). Based on the results of the 
backgroun d soil sampling conducted during the SI, only 15 residential properties were found to 
have lead concentrations greater than three times the background level, for a total resident 
population of 44.7 (Ref. 7, p.53). The facility is located within a large ind ustrial area with 
numerous nearby potential sources, and there is no conclusive evidence that the facility is the sole 
source of lead contamination in the residential area (Ref. 7, p.76). 
Surface Water Migration Pathway: The nearest major surface water body is the Los Angeles River, 
approximately 0.15 -miles southwest of the former Exide Technologies – Vernon facility (Ref. 7, 
p. 53, 61 ). On -site surface water runoff is collected in a retention basin and directed to an on -site 
wastewater treatment plant (Ref. 7, p.97). 
Subsurface Intrusion Component of the Soil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion Pathway: Based 
on previous soil vapor monitoring conducted at the Exide -Vernon facility, volatized TCE was 
present in the subsurface soil, however, structures at the facility have not been occupied since 2014 
and are currently being deconstructed (Ref. 7 , p.53). Indoor air samples were collected from both  
    
 
 
   
  
     
     
  
 
  
 the engineering building and employee facilities buildings showed that TCE was detected at 
concentrations below the commercial indoor air screening level (Ref. 7, p.23) 
Air Migration Pathway: Historical operations at the former Exide -Vernon facility resulted in lead 
and other heavy metals being emitted and deposited to the ground and other surfaces at the facility 
and in the surrounding areas, however, based on air modeling conducted at the site there is no 
conclusive evidence that the facility is the sole source of lead contamination in the residential area 
(Ref. 7, p. 54). The facility has not been in operation since 2014 (Ref. 7, p.54).

The street address , coordinates, and contaminant locations presented in this HRS documentation record identify the 
general area where the site is located . They represent one or more locations the U nited States Environmental Protection 
Agency ( EPA ) considers to be part of the site based on the screening information EPA used to evaluate the site for 
NPL listing . EPA lists national priorities among the known "releases or threatened releases" of hazardous substances; 
thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely delineated bou ndaries . A site is defined as where a hazardous substance 
has been "deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has otherwise come to be located." Generally, HRS scoring and 
the subsequent listing of a release merely represent the initial determination that a certain area may need to be 
addressed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation & Liability Act (CERCLA ). 
Accordingly, EPA contemplates that the preliminary description of facility boundaries at the time of scoring will be 
refined as more information is developed as to where the contamination has come to be located. 
1 “Ground water” and “groundwater” are synonymous; the spelling is different due to “ground water” being codified 
as part of the HRS, while “groundwater” is the modern spelling.

 EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON 
SITE DESCRIPTION 
The former Exide Technologies – Vernon (Exide -Vernon) facility is located at 2700 South Indiana 
Street in the City of Vernon, Los Angeles County, California, 90058 (Figure A -1 of this HRS 
documentation record; Ref. 4, p. 9). For Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scoring purposes, the 
“Site” consists of the release of hazardous substances from former operations associated with the 
Exide facility. Hazardous substances associated with the HRS source includes trichloroethylene 
(TCE) (see Section 2.2 and subsections o f this HRS documentation record). 
The Exide facility began lead recycling operations in 1922. By 1982, the facility was conducting 
battery recycling and lead -refining operations in which lead -acid batteries were crushed and 
recycled in a secondary lead smelter system at the former Vernon p lant (Ref. 5, p.42). 
Previous owners of the facility included Morris P. Kirk & Sons, NL Industries, Gould Inc., and 
GNB Inc. Exide Technologies , Inc. acquired the property in 2000, and continued operations until 
closure in 2014, following a 2013 Stipulation and Order issued by the California Department of 
Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) that ordered Exide to temporarily suspend facility operations 
(Ref. 4, p.4; Ref. 5, p.42). Since 2013, DTSC has overseen numerous on -site and off -site 
investigations, as well as the implantation of a 2016 Final Closure Plan (Ref. 64, p.5 -6). 
In October 2020, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued an order that allowed Exide Technologies, Inc. 
to transfer it to an environmental response trust. The Vernon Environmental Response Trust 
(VERT) was created to facilitate the continuation of the cleanup activ ities (Ref. 64, p.6). Since 
October 2021, EPA and DTSC have overseen the actions of the VERT at the Exide -Vernon facility 
(Ref. 64, p.5 -6). 
Historical activities conducted at the Exide -Vernon facility included battery breaking; secondary 
smelting; lead refining; storage, handling, and transportation of batteries and other materials 
associated with recycling operations; and chemical processing (Ref. 5, p.42). Air emissions from 
stacks; inadequate maintenance and repair of the containment building; spills at the Exide -Vernon 
facility and spills from trucks transporting material to and from the facility; releases from a 
stormwater containment and other liquid containments; and insufficient dust controls contributed 
to the release and dispersion of lead -impacted airborne particulates (Ref. 5, p.42; Ref 6, p.5) 
TCE contamination within the footprint of the old mixed -metals extrusion building, identified as 
Solid Waste Management Unit No. 11 (SWMU -11) in the southern portion of the facility (referred 
to as the “South Yard”), is elevated based on the HRS criteria (three times background) and 
exceeds the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) allowed for public drinking water sources 
(Figure A -2 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 7, p.3 0-32). 
TCE was used as a cooling medium during the extrusion of metal bars and stock into various 
shapes (Ref. 9, p.34). As documented in a 1986 Phase I Site Assessment and a 1990 RCRA Facility 
Assessment (RFA), the TCE was stored in 20 -pound containers immediate ly south of SWMU -11 
and was taken from the storage area and poured into an open storage vat that fed the extrusion 
process (Ref. 8, p.44; Ref. 65, p.16). It is unknown what happened to the excess TCE after the 
extrusion process, however ongoing releases re portedly occurred throughout the lifespan of

operations ( Ref. 8, p. 44; Ref. 9, p.34). It is unknown exactly when operations were started in this 
location; however, the mixed -metal operations ceased in approximately 1978 (Ref. 8, p. 44; Ref. 
9, p. 34 ). Based on facility conditions and environmental investigations conducted, it is believed 
that the contamination found beneath SWMU -11 likely originated from surface releases of TCE 
(Ref. 8, p.6, 44; Ref. 9, p.34; Ref. 10, p.313 -316; Ref. 12, p.12 ). 
A dissolved phase fraction entered the groundwater and began to slowly migrate south -southeast 
with the hydraulic gradient. Based on the geology underlying SWMU -11, it appears that upon 
release, the TCE migrated vertically through approximately 75 feet of unsaturated sediments over 
time (Ref. 12, p.12). 
Soil and soil vapor samples collected in the vicinity of SWMU -11 in 2005 and 2015 indicated 
significantly elevated concentrations of TCE in soil to a depth of 70 feet bgs, and in soil vapor to 
a depth of 68 feet bgs (Ref. 9, p.92 , 113 -114; Ref. 12, p.35, 37 , 46). 
On July 1, 2022, the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) requested that the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) evaluate the former Exide facility and surrounding 
areas potentially impacted by the former facility’s operations, as a candidate for the National 
Priorities List (NPL) (Ref. 13, p.1 -2). 
In November 2022, EPA completed a Preliminary Assessment (PA) at the former Exide -Vernon 
facility. The primary objective of the PA was to evaluate existing information to be used in the 
HRS characterization process, including source areas and levels of con tamination in surface soil.  
The PA, which relied primarily on soil data collected by DTSC, concluded that the Exide – Vernon 
facility is a documented source of lead contamination and that historical operations at the facility 
likely contributed to the emi ssion and deposition of lead along with other heavy metals onto the 
soil and other surfaces around the facility and surrounding areas. (Ref. 4, p.4 -6, 19 -20). 
A Site Inspection (SI) was initiated in January 2023 with the initial objective to augment DTSC 
collected soils and groundwater data, however, EPA determined that DTSC’s existing background 
data and residential sampling protocols needed to be amended to comport with HRS requirements 
(Ref. 7, p p. 10, 18). This resulted in an extensive background soil collection effort, modifications 
to DTSC -executed residential sampling beginning May 1, 2023, and supplemental groundwater 
sampling in the south yard (Ref. 7, p.10). The data and documentation identified d uring the SI was 
determined to be insufficient to meet the criteria for consideration under the HRS for the soil 
exposure pathway (Ref. 7, p.52). However, b ased on the results of the SI, as well as historical on -
site sampling results, an observed release of TCE to groundwater within the Exposition through 
Jefferson hydrologic unit was established (Ref. 7, p.47). TCE was detected in the groundwater 
release sample collected from Exposition aquifer in 2021 at a concentration of 47 µg/L, which is 
considered significantly above background based on the result of 15 µg/L collected from the 
background well (Ref. 7, p. 47). This release is attributable, at l east in part, to the Exide -Vernon 
facility as a sample was collected immediately downgradient of an area of documented TCE soil 
contamination, which was a result of historical operations (Ref. 7, p.47). 
There are 52 known active drinking water wells within the 4 -mile Target Distance Limit (TDL) of 
the source. These wells, which are operated by 14 distinct water purveyors, serve an estimated 
19 Site Description

apportioned population of 306,890.50 (Ref. 34, p.1 -18; Figure A -6 of this HRS documentation 
record). Of these 52 wells, 17 were identified as having at least some portion of their screening 
interval consistent with the depths of the Exposition through Jeff erson hydrologic unit, which 
serves an estimated population of 133,7 46.29 (Ref. 33, p.1 -17).

2.2.1 SOURCE IDENTIFICATION 
Name of Source : SWMU -11 Number of Source : 1 
Source Type : Contaminated Soil 
Description and Location of Source (see Figure A-2 of this HRS documentation record ): 
On-site soils are contaminated with TCE, which is likely a result of historical on -site operations 
within the South Yard of the Exide -Vernon facility , identified as SWMU -11. SWMU -11 is located 
within the footprint of the old mixed -metals extrusion building . As shown on historical Sanborn 
Maps (Ref. 66, p.7), the old mixed -metals extrusion building was located immediately west of the 
current engineering building and had a size of approximately 10,000 ft2 (Ref.8, p.44). 
TCE was used as a cooling medium during the extrusion of metal bars and stock into various 
shapes (Ref. 9, p.34). As documented in a 1986 Phase I Site Assessment and a 1990 RCRA Facility 
Assessment (RFA), the TCE was stored in 20 -pound containers immediate ly south of SWMU -11 
and was taken from the storage area and poured into an open storage vat that fed the extrusion 
process (Ref. 8, p.44; Ref. 65, p.16). It is unknown what happened to the excess TCE after the 
extrusion process, however ongoing releases re portedly occurred throughout the lifespan of 
operations ( Ref. 8, p. 44; Ref. 9, p.34). It is unknown exactly when operations were started in this 
location; however, the mixed -metal operations ceased in approximately 1978 (Ref. 8, p.44 ; Ref. 9, 
p. 34 ).
Based on facility conditions and environmental investigations conducted, it is believed that the 
contamination found beneath SWMU -11 likely originated from surface releases of TCE (Ref. 8, 
p.6, 44; Ref. 9, p.34; Ref. 10, p.313 -316; Ref. 11, p.85). Based on previous on -site soil vapor
monitoring, the TCE likely volatilized into the soil gas. Soil and soil vapor samples collected in
the vicinity of SWMU -11 in 2005 and 2015 indicated significantly elevated concentrations of TCE
(Ref. 10, p.313 -316). As part of the 2005 Phase 2 RFI conducted by Exide’s contractor, the TCE -
impacted subsurface soil in the South Yard was assessed to determine the extent of subsurface
contamination and potential vapor intrusion impacts (Ref. 9, p. 60, 80 -83). A subsequent
investigation of TCE impacted soil beneath SWMU -11 was conducted in 2015 under the
supervision of DTSC (Ref. 10, p.313 -316).
Based on the geology underlying SWMU -11, the TCE appears to have migrated vertically through 
approximately 75 feet of unsaturated sediments , where a dissolved phase fraction entered the 
groundwater and began slowly migrating south -southeast consistent with hydraulic gradient (Ref 
12, p.12) . In addition, groundwater m onitoring wells were installed in 1986 and 1987 at the 
location of the former storage vats where levels of TCE have been observed at an order of

p.31-32, Ref. 11, p.85 ).

The full extent of contaminated soil at SWMU -11 (Source 1) could not be adequately determined, 
however based on soil and soil vapor sampling conducted from 2005 through 2015, it is estimated 
to cover a surface area of at least 14,950 ft2, with an approximate depth of at least 7 5 feet below 
the ground surface (ft bgs). (Ref. 9, p.92, 113 -114; Ref. 10, p.313 -316; Ref. 12, p. 35, 37, 46; see 
Figure A -4 of this HRS documentation record ). 
2.2.2 HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SOURCE 
On-site soils at SWMU -11 (Source 1) are contaminated with TCE, which is likely a result of 
historical on -site operations within the South Yard. As part of the 2005 Phase 2 RFI conducted 
by Exide’s contractor, the TCE -impacted subsurface soil beneath SWMU -11 was assessed to 
determine the extent of subsurface contamination and potential vapor intrusion impacts . A 
subsequent investigation of TCE impacted soil beneath SWMU -11 was conducted in 2015 under 
the supervision of DTSC ( Ref. 9, p.80 -83). 
As shown in the table below and Figure A -3 of this HRS documentation record, soil samples from 
SWMU -11 were collected from 8 soil borings (two in 2005, one in 2014, and five in 2015) at 
depths ranging from 1 ft to 76 ft bgs (Ref.10, p.313 -316). The highest TCE soil result observed in 
shallow soil was 990 micrograms per kilogram ( µg/kg ) at a depth of 1.5 feet ( Ref. 10, p. 149; Ref. 
12, p.35). The highest TCE soil result observed in deeper soil was 150 µg/kg at a depth of 70 feet 
(Ref.9, p. 92). 
Based on the geology underlying SWMU -11, it appears that upon release, the TCE migrated 
vertically through approximately 75 feet of unsaturated sediments over time ( Ref. 12, p. 42-43). 
As shown in the table below and Figure A -4 of this HRS documentation record , a total of 68 soil 
vapor samples (including 4 duplicate samples) were collected from 27 temporary vapor probes (23 
probes in 2005, four probes in 2015) at depths ranging from 0.5 ft to 68 ft bgs. The maximum 
documented TCE soil vapor concentration observ ed in shallow soil was 220 μg/L at a depth of 5 
feet ( Ref. 9, p. 108; Ref. 12, p. 36). The maximum documented TCE soil vapor result observed in 
deeper subsurface soil was 730 μg/L at a depth of 68 feet ( Ref. 12, p.3 7). The vapor data indicate 
that the concentration of vapor -phase TCE decreases with depth suggesting that the source was 
surficial in nature (Ref. 12, p.11) . 
The TCE contamination appears to have migrated to the groundwater beneath Source 1, as 
discussed in Section 3.1 .1 of this HRS Documentation Record.

2.4.2. HAZARDOUS WASTE QUANTITY 
2.4.2.1.1  Hazardous Constituent Quantity (Tier A) 
The hazardous constituent quantity for the contaminated soil at SWMU -11 (Source 1) could not 
be adequately determined according to the HRS requirements; that is, the total mass of all 
CERCLA hazardous substances in the source and releases from the source is not known and cannot 
be estimated with reasonable confidence (Ref. 1, Section 2. 4.2.1.1). There are insufficient 
historical and current data (manifests, potentially responsible party [PRP] records, State records, 
permits, waste concentration data, etc.) available to adequately calculate the total or partial mass 
of all CERCLA hazardou s substances in the source and the associated releases from the source. 
Therefore, there is insufficient information to evaluate the associated releases from the source to 
calculate the hazardous constituent quantity for Source 1 with reasonable confidence . Scoring 
proceeds to the evaluation of Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity (Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.1). 
Hazardous Constituent Quantity Value: Not Evaluated 
2.4.2.1.2  Hazardous Wastestream Quantity (Tier B) 
The hazardous wastestream quantity for the contaminated soil at SWMU -11 (Source 1 ) could not 
be adequately determined according to the HRS requirements; that is, the mass of the wastestreams 
containing hazardous substances, and eligible pollutants and contaminants in the source and 
releases from the source is not known and cannot be est imated with reasonable confidence (Ref. 
1, Section 2.4.2.1.2). There are insufficient historical and current data (manifests, PRP records, 
State records, permits, waste conce ntration data, etc.) available to adequately calculate the total or 
partial mass of the wastestream plus the mass of all CERCLA pollutants and contaminants in the 
source and the associated releases from the source. Therefore, there is insufficient informat ion to 
evaluate the associated releases from the source to calculate the hazardous wastestream quantity 
for Source 1 with reasonable confidence. Scoring proceeds to the evaluation of Tier C, volume 
(Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.2). 
Hazardous Wastestream Quantity Value : Not Evaluated 
2.4.2.1.3  Volume (Tier C) 
The exact volume for the contaminated soil at SWMU -11 (Source 1) could not be adequately 
determined according to the HRS requirements (Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.3). Monitoring wells , 
subsurface soil vapor samples, and subsurface soil samples located within SWMU -11 contained 
TCE at concentrations significantly above background to depths of at least 70 ft bgs (Ref.9, p.92; 
Ref. 12, p. 35 ; see Tables in section 2.2.2 of this HRS documentation record ). However, the 
boundaries and total depths of the plume are not sufficiently defined to get an exact volume . As 
the volume cann ot be determined with reasonable confidence , the volume measure value of 0 is 
assigned as per HRS Section 2.4.2.1.3 . Scoring proceeds to the evaluation of Tier D, area (Ref. 1, 
Section 2.4.2.1. 3).

The area of contaminated soil at SWMU -11 (Source 1) could not be adequately determined, 
however based on soil and soil vapor sampling conducted in 2005 and 2015, it is estimated to 
cover an area of at least 14,950 ft2 (Ref.9, p.92; Ref. 12, p. 35 ; see Figure A -3 of this HRS

3.0 GROUND WATER MIGRATION PATHWAY 
3.0.1  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Ground Water Migration Pathway Description 
Based on historical on -site sampling results, an observed release from the facility to groundwater 
within the Exposition aquifer has been documented (see Section 3.1.1 of this document for 
documentation of the observed release ). For this HRS consideration, hazardous substances 
associated with the observed release includes TCE, which has been detected at concentrations 
significantly above background in monitoring wells immediately downgradient of SWMU -11 
(Source 1) where TCE was used as a cooling medium duri ng the metals extrusion process (Ref. 9, 
p.34).
TCE has consistently been detected above the MCLs in the perched zone beneath SWMU -11 since 
the 1980s and detected above the MCL in the Exposition aquifer since 2015, when monitoring 
wells screened within the Exposition aquifer were installed (see Section s 2.2 and 3.1.1 of this HRS 
document ation record ). 
Regional Geology/Aquifer Description 
The Exide -Vernon facility lies within the Central Subbasin in the Coastal Plain of the Los Angeles 
Groundwater Basin. The Central Subbasin is generally bound to the north by the folded, uplifted, 
and eroded Tertiary basement rocks of the La Brea High surface divide; to the northeas t and east 
by the less permeable Tertiary rocks of the Elysian, Repetto, Merced, and Puente Hills; to the 
southeast by the Coyote Creek (approximate Los Angeles County/Orange County boundary); and 
to the southwest by the Newport Inglewood Uplift, a regiona l anticline associated with the 
Newport Inglewood fault system. (Ref. 27, p.118 -119, 168-169; Ref. 28, p.1 -2). 
The Central Subbasin has historically been divided into the Los Angeles Forebay at the northwest, 
the Montebello Forebay at the north, the Whittier Area at the northeast, and the Central Basin 
Pressure Area at the center and southwest. However, these areal distinctions are appropriate for 
geographical purposes only and do not accurately represent hydrogeologic conditions within the 
areas. In actuality, the hydrogeologic forebays, which are generally characterized by unconfined 
and relatively interconnected aquifer systems, are limited to only small regions within the greater 
Forebay areas (Ref. 27, p.168 -169, 193 -198). 
The Montebello Forebay, as well as the Los Angeles Forebay to a lesser degree, serves as the 
primary groundwater recharge areas for both shallow and deep aquifers across the entirety of the 
subbasin. The Central Basin Pressure Area is generally characteriz ed by confined aquifer systems 
separated by relatively impermeable clay layers, although semipermeable zones within these layers 
allow aquifers to be interconnected in some areas. These semipermeable zones gradually decrease 
in frequency and magnitude with increasing distance from the forebays ( Ref. 27, p. 168-169, 186 -
187, 193 -198; Ref. 28, p.1 -2).

Throughout much of the subbasin, the Pleistocene -age aquifers are under confined conditions due 
to the presence of fine -grained, low -permeability interbedded sediments. Although these fine 
grained sediments, or aquicludes, generally restrict the downward m igration of groundwater from 
overlying aquifers, semipermeable zones within the aquicludes allow aquifers to be interconnected 
in some areas (Ref. 27, p.168 -169). In addition, hydrogeologic modeling of multi -aquifer systems 
similar to that found in the Cen tral Basin Pressure Area, has shown that groundwater wells 
screened across multiple aquifers (or wells with improperly constructed annular seals that cross 
multiple aquifers) can act as a direct pathway for the migration of significant volumes of shallow 
groundwater into deep confined aquifers when vertical hydraulic head variations create a 
downward hydraulic gradient. The process of this downward migration has increased in areas 
where the deeper aquifers have periods of high -volume pumping such as seasona l demand. 
Furthermore, additional studies have shown that liquids that are denser than water (i.e., dense non -
aqueous phase liquids [DNAPLs] such as PCE and TCE) can migrate downward through a multi -
aquifer well even when vertical hydraulic head variations create an upward hydraulic gradient 
(Ref. 27, p. 168-169; Ref. 29, p.13 -17; Ref. 31, p. 1-4). 
The regional groundwater flow direction within the subbasin, which was calculated using data 
from wells screened within the Upper San Pedro Formation (Lynwood through Silverado aquifers), 
is generally to the southwest. Based upon data collected between 200 7 and 2022, flow within these 
deeper aquifers in the vicinity of the Exide -Vernon facility trended towards the southwest with 
temporal variations from west to south -southwest ( Ref. 32, p.21 -22, 69, 72 -86). 
Geologic units typically found beneath the subbasin include : 
•Holocene -age Alluvium : Recent alluvium is primarily stream deposited gravel, sand, silt
and clay with some interbedded littoral and estuary or bay deposits near the ocean.
Geologic members found within the alluvial deposits include the Semiperched aquifer,
Bellflower aquiclude, Gaspur aquifer, and Ballona aquifer (Ref. 27, p p. 63-64).
oSemiperched Aquifer : Includes c oarse sands and gravels found on or near the
surface of much of the Coastal Plain of Los Angeles County , varying in thickness
from 0 to 60 feet and may contain significant amounts of unconfined water (Ref.
27, p.64 , 172 ).
oBellflower Aquiclude : Directly beneath the Semiperched aquifer, with sediments of
lesser permeability that restrict some vertical movement of ground water, varying
in thickness from 0 to 200 feet , and has a maximum depth of 100 feet (Ref. 27,
p.65-66, 172 ).
oGaspur Aquifer : Water -bearing zone directly beneath the Bellflower aquiclude,
where the upper part is medium to coarse -textured sand while the lower part
consists of sand, gravel, and cobbles as large as five inches in diameter, with a
thickness ranging up to about 120 feet, and a maximum depth of 160 feet (Ref. 27,
p.66-67, 173 ).
oBallona Aquifer : Water -bearing zone found in a relatively small area in the

northwest section of the basin, composed of coarse sand, rounded to subrounded 
gravel, and cobbles up to five inches in diameter that are of both granitic and 
metamorphic origin , varying in thickness from 10 to 40 feet (Ref. 27 , p.69 -70). 
•Upper Pleistocene Lakewood Formation : Underlying the recent alluvium is the Lakewood
Formation, where the upper part includes rapid lithologic changes, with discontinuous
permeable zones and considerable variation in particle size, typical of stream alluviation
with fine -grained sediments, and the lower part includes gravels and coarse sands, confined
to a nar row extension reaching the Newport -Inglewood uplift. The Lakewood formation
is divided into the contemporaneous Artesia and Exposition aquifers, the hydraulic
continu ous Gage and Gardena aquifers, and the unnamed aquicludes between the aquifers
(Ref. 27, p.74 -75).
oArtesia Aquifer : Water -bearing zone of varying thickness, composed of coarse
gravel, coarse to fin e sand and interbedded silts and clays , generally below the
southern end of the Gaspur aquifer , and appears to be related to the San Gabriel
River, Coyote Creek, and Santa Ana River system (Ref. 27, p.75 -76, 280, 284).
Stratigraphically, the Artesia aquifer is generally deeper than the Gaspur aquifer,
however some upper reaches abut directly with the Gaspur, and there are multiple
uplift locations where the Art esia aquifer is higher in elevation (Ref. 27, p.77).
oExposition Aquifer: Water -bearing zone with a maximum thickness of 100 feet, and
a maximum depth of 160 feet, consisting of sand and gravel members separated by
discontinuous lenses of silt and clay, generally below the northern end of the
Gaspur aquifer , and appears to be related to the Los Angeles River drainage system
(Ref. 27, p.75, 77, 173, 280, 284). Stratigraphically, as with the Artesia aquifer, the
Exposition aquifer is generally deeper than the Gaspur aquifer, while some upper
reaches abut directly with the Gaspur, with multiple uplift locations where the
Exposition aquifer is higher in elevation (Ref. 27, p.77). Lower members of the
Exposition extend beneath the Gaspur aquifer and merge laterally with the Artesia
aquifer , and horizontally with the underlying Gage aquifer (Ref. 27, p.77).
oGage Aquifer : Water -bearing zone as deep as 350 feet, with a maximum thickness
of 10 to 160 feet, comprised of fine to coarse sand with variable amounts of gravel,
sandy silt, and clay (Ref. 27, p.78). The Gage aquifer is hydraulically connected
with contemporaneous Gardena aquifer, overlapping throughout the basin (Ref. 27,
p.79). The combined Gage -Gardena aquifer merges with the shallower Exposition
aquifer near the Montebello plain, and merges with the deeper Lynwood and
Sunnyside aquifers in the western part of the basin (Ref. 27, p.77, 80 , 300, 304).
oGardena Aquifer: Similar in thickness , elevation to maximum depth of 290 feet ,
and composition to those of the Gage aquifer , and hydraulically continuous with
the Gage throughout much of its extent (Ref. 27, p.80, 82 , 174 ). The combined
Gage -Gardena aquifer merges with the shallower Exposition aquifer near the
Montebello plain, and merges with the deeper Lynwood and Sunnyside aquifers in
the western part of the basin (Ref. 27, p.77, 80. 300, 304).

•Lower Pleistocene San Pedro Formation : Underlying the unnamed upper Pleistocene
deposits of the Lakewood Formation , the San Pedro Formation includes all lower
Pleistocene strata and deposits which underl ying the West Basin (Ref. 27, p.82). The San
Pedro Formation and is comprised of sand deposits with some fine gravel, silty sand, and
clay, containing the Hollydale, Jefferson, Lynwood, Silverado, and Sunnyside aquifers
(Ref. 27, p p. 83, 84).
oHollydale Aquifer: Uppermost aquifer within the San Pedro formation , consist ing
of sands and gravels in the northeastern portion of the area, and sands with muds,
clays, and marine shells toward the Newport -Inglewood uplift , with a thickness of
10 to 100 feet and a maximum depth of 475 feet (Ref. 27, p.85 , 174 ). The Hollydale
aquifer is discontinuous in extent, with an irregular, sinuous course, and does not
yield large quantities of water , recharg ing only where it merges with the overlying
Gage -Gardena aquifer (Ref. 27, p.85, 86 , 312 ).
oJefferson Aquifer : Water -bearing zone comprised of fine -grained sediments, and
sand with gravelly and clayey lenses, with a thickness up to 140 feet and a
maximum depth of 640 feet , and is considerably folded (Ref. 27, p.87 , 174 ).
Although it does not crop out on the surface, the Jefferson aquifer does merge with
the overlying Hollydale aquifer and with the Gage -Gardena aquifer at multiple
locations (Ref. 27, p.88 , 320 ).
oLynwood Aquifer : Water -bearing zone comprised c ontinental deposits of coarse
gravels, sands, silts, and clays, and marine deposits of sand, gravel , silts, and clays ,
with a thickness between 50 and 200 feet and a maximum depth of 720 feet (Ref.
27, p.89 , 175 ). While there are known areas where the Lynwood aquifer merges
with overlying aquifers, t he lack of continuous permeable materials to conduct
water vertically downward limits the recharging (Ref. 27, p.91 , 328, 332 ).
oSilverado Aquifer : Water -bearing zone comprised c ontinental deposits of coarse to
fine sands and gravels are interbedded with silts and clays, and marine deposits of
sand, gravel, silt, and clay, with a maximum thickness of 500 feet and a maximum
depth of 1,070 feet (Ref. 27, p.91 -92, 175 ). The Silverado aquifer is in hydraulic
continuity with the Gage -Garden and the Lynwood aquifers, and merges with the
Lynwood, Jefferson, Hollydale and Gage -Gardena aquifers in the Montebello
Forebay Area (Ref. 27, p.93 , 344, 348 ).
oSunnyside Aquifer : Water -bearing zone comprised of coarse -grained sands and
gravels separated by fine -grained interbeds of sandy clay and clay, with a maximum
thickness of 300 feet and a maximum depth of 1,600 feet (Ref. 27, p.95). The
Sunnyside merges with the Silverado and other overlying aquifers in multiple areas
(Ref. 27, p.96 , 360 ).
The Exide -Vernon facility is located within the eastern portion of the Los Angeles Forebay 
geographical area (Ref. 27, p.212) ; however, underlying hydrogeologic conditions are more

accurately represented by those typically identified with the Central Basin Pressure Area (Ref.27, 
p.232, 248) . Groundwater beneath the facility is typically found within the coarser -grained
sediments of the upper Pleistocene Lakewood Formation (Exposition and Gage -Gardena aquifers),
and the lower Pleistocene San Pedro Formation (Hollydale, Jefferson, Lynwood, Silverado, and
Sunnyside aquifers) (Ref. 22, p.10 ; Ref. 28, p.1 -2).
The elevations and depths of the aquifers underlying the Exide -Vernon facility , as estimated from 
published source material, are presented in the table below . Irregular patches of a perched or semi -
perched aquifer are also present within the Holocene alluvium throughout much of the subbasin. 
Although significant amounts of water can be found within these perched water -bearing zones, 
they are often discontinuous over rela tively short distances and have historically only had minimal 
economic benefit. Thus, th ese perched aquifers do not meet the criteria of an “aquifer” for HRS 
purposes ( Ref. 22, p.10; Ref. 28, p.1 -2).

For the purposes of this HRS Documentation Record , the Exposition aquifer beneath the Exide -
Vernon facility is defined as being between 95 ft bgs and 175 ft bgs; which is based on the data 
reported in the 2021 Groundwater Monitoring Report (Ref. 22, p.10) . Water -bearing units 
identified at shallower depths are defined as being associated with one or more perched (or semi -
perched) aquifers. During historical on -site investigations, discontinuous zones of saturated soils 
were identified at depths between app roximately 73 ft bgs and 90 ft bgs. These depths are 
consistent with the lower portion of the generally fine -grained unit that is commonly referred to as 
the Bellflower aquitard (or aquiclude) (Ref. 22, p.10) . 
Based on historical subsurface investigations at the Exide -Vernon facility , the soil underlying the 
property is composed primarily of sand and silt with lesser amounts of clay and humus (Ref. 5, p. 
44). Non -native soil fill materials have been documented down to a depth of approximately 4 5 ft 
bgs in the vicinity of the facility (Ref. 10, p.12).

There are currently 24 on -property and four off -property wells that are regularly monitored within 
the “perched zone” and 10 on -site and five off -site wells that are regularly monitored within the 
Exposition aquifer. Declining water levels have been observed within both zones and, since 2019, 
ten of the “perched” wells and four of the “Exposition” wells have been documented as dry. Due 
to the discontinuous nature of the “perched” zones across the facility , it is not meaningful to 
calculate a generalized flo w direction; however, the flow direction of the Exposition aquifer 
beneath the facility has been calculated as being towards the southwest during the October 2023 
SI groundwater sampling event ( Ref. 7, p. 43; Ref . 22, p.10 ).

3.0.1.2  Aquifer Boundaries/Site Geology 
Stratum 1: Interconnected Exposition through Jefferson Aquifers 
Each stratum in the Central Subbasin is described above in Section 3.0.1. Groundwater flow across 
the aquifers within both the Los Angeles Forebay and Central Basin Pressure Area have been 
documented in various locations between the Exposition (and hydrological continuous Gaspur) 
and the Gage -Gardena aquifers, the Gage -Gardena and Hollydale aquifers, and the Hollydale and 
Jefferson aquifers (Ref. 27, p.192 -195). The State of California, Department of Water Resources’ 
Bulletin No. 104 (Planned Utilization of the Ground Water Basins of the Coastal Plain of Los 
Angeles County) – Appendix A presents “idealized” geologic cross -sections transecting the 
Central Subbasin. These cross -sections indicate apparent areas of merged aquifers throughout 
much of the subbasin. Aquifer interconnection within 2 miles of Source 1 has been documented 
between the Exposition through Jefferson aquifers . As such, these two aquifers, as well as the 
intervening Gage -Gardena and Hollydale aquifers, are considered to be a single hydrologic unit 
for HRS purposes (Ref. 7, p. 42, 43 ; Ref. 27, p. 232, 248, 280, 284, 296, 300, 312, 316 , 320 , 324, 
384, 388, 392, 396 ). 
3.0.1.1.1 Aquifer Interconnections 
Interconnections between the Exposition aquifer and contemporaneous Gage and Gardena aquifers 
have been documented approximately 1.4 miles east of Source 1 (Ref. 27, p. 75-77, 193, 232, 248, 
280, 284 , 296, 300 ). Interconnections between the merged Exposition/Gage -Gardena aquifer and 
Hollydale aquifer have been documented approximately 1.65 miles northwest of Source 1 (Ref. 
27, p.85, 193-194, 248, 280, 284, 296, 300, 312, 316 ). Interconnections between the merged 
Exposition/Gage -Gardena/Hollydale aquifer and Jefferson aquifer have been documented 
approximately 1.95 miles northwest of Source 1 (Ref. 27, p.88, 193-194, 248, 280, 284, 296, 300, 
312, 316, 320, 324 ). 
Elevated concentrations of TCE have been documented in groundwater collected from wells 
screened in the aforementioned aquifers within 2 miles of Source 1, further indicating the 
interconnection. In addition to monitoring wells in the vicinity of Source 1 used to establish the 
observed release to the Expositi on aquifer, TCE has been detected from the following drinking 
water wells within 2 miles:

3.0.1.1.2 Aquifer Discontinuities 
An aquifer discontinuity occurs for scoring purposes only when a geologic, topographic, or other 
structure or feature entirely transects an aquifer within the 4-mile target distance limit, thereby 
creating a continuous boundary to groundwater flow within this limit (Ref. 1, Section 3.0.1.2.2). 
There are no known or suspected discontinuities within the Exposition, Gage -Gardena, or 
Jefferson aquifers within 4 miles of Source 1 , based on historic aquifer elevation maps and cross -
sections (Ref. 27, p.232, 248, 280, 284, 296, 300, 320, 324) . 
The Hollydale aquifer has been reported to be potentially discontinuous in extent , where h istoric 
aquifer elevation maps have shown sinuous irregular courses of the aquifer within the Central 
Basin, including an area from approximately 1.4 miles to 1.9 miles, and 2.8 miles to 4.0 miles 
southeast of Source 1, where the aquifer elevations have not been sufficiently documented (Ref. 
27, p.85, 248, 312 , 316; Figure A -7 of this HRS Documentation Record ). 
For the purposes of this HRS Documentation Record , the Exposition aquifer beneath the Exide -
Vernon facility is defined as being between 95 ft bgs and 175 ft bgs; which is based on the data 
reported in the 2021 Groundwater Monitoring Report (Ref. 22, p.10) . Water -bearing units 
identified at shallower depths are defined as being associated with one or more perched (or semi -
perched) aquifers. During historical on -site investigations, discontinuous zones of saturated soils 
were identified at depths between app roximately 73 ft bgs and 90 ft bgs. These depths are 
consistent with the lower portion of the generally fine -grained unit that is commonly referred to as 
the Bellflower aquitard (or aquiclude) (Ref. 22, p.10) .

There are currently 24 on -property and four off -property wells that are regularly monitored within 
the “perched zone” and 10 on -site and five off -site wells that are regularly monitored within the 
Exposition aquifer. Declining water levels have been observed within both zones and, since 2019, 
ten of the “perched” wells and four of the “Exposition” wells have been documented as dry. Due 
to the discontinuous nature of the “perched” zones across the facility , it is not meaningful to 
calculate a generalized flo w direction; however, the flow direction of the Exposition aquifer 
beneath the facility has been calculated as being towards the southwest during the October 2023 
SI groundwater sampling event (Ref. 7, p. 43; Ref . 22, p.10 ).

3.1 LIKELIHOOD OF RELEASE 
3.1.1 OBSERVED RELEASE 
Aquifer Being Evaluated: Exposition through Jefferson Hydrologic Unit 
Observed Release by Chemical Analysis 
The minimum standard to establish an observed release by chemical analysis is analytical evidence 
of a hazardous substance significantly above the background level and some portion of the 
significant increase above the background level is attributable to the site. In accordance w ith HRS 
Table 2 -3, if the background concentration is not detected, a significant increase is established 
when the sample measurement equals or exceeds the sample quantitation limit (SQL). If the 
background concentration equals or exceeds the detection lim it, a significant increase is 
established when the sample measurement is 3 times or more above the background concentration. 
If the sample analysis was performed under the EPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP), the 
EPA contract -required quantitation limit (CRQL) can be used in place of the SQL if the SQL is 
not available ( Ref. 1, Section 2.3 ). 
As shown in the table below and Figure A -5 of this HRS documentation record, o n-site monitoring 
wells screened in the perched zone have been regularly sampled since 1986, and monitoring wells 
screened in the Exposition aquifer have been regularly sampled since 2015 . TCE has been detected 
above EPA Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) in monitoring wells screened within the 
perched zone beneath SWMU -11 (Source 1), and the Exposition aquifer immediately 
downgradient of SWMU -11 (See Section 2.2.2 of this HRS D ocument ation Record and the 
SWMU -11 Perched Zone Groundwater Sampling Result Summary and Downgradient Release 
Well and Background Well Sampling Results Tables in this section ). 
SWMU -11 (Source 1) Perched Zone Monitoring Wells 
As shown in the table below and Figure A -5 of this HRS Documentation Record, two monitoring 
wells (PW -2 and MW -14) installed beneath SWMU -11 and one well immediately downgradient 
of SWMU -11 (MW -11) have been sampled since 1987. The maximum documented TCE 
concentration of 5,500 microgram per Liter (µg/L) was observed at PW -2 in August 2000 (Ref. 9, 
p.143). The maximum documented TCE concentration of 2,500 µg/L was observed at MW -14 in
May 1999 (Ref. 9, p.141, 144; Figure A -5 of this HRS Documentation Record ). The maximum
documented TCE concentration of 2,500 µg/L was observed at MW -11 in September 1999 (Ref.
9, p.138).
Due to the discontinuous nature of the perched zone across the Exide -Vernon facility, there are no 
suitable monitoring wells to represent background concentrations in the perched zone, however 
TCE results from the nearest “upgradient” well, MW -12, and “downgradient” well, MW -11, are 
discussed to provide supplemental and contextual information to confirm the presence and extent 
of Source 1. 
Between 1996 and 2005, TCE concentrations in “upgradient” perched zone monitoring well MW-
12 were regularly below the MCL and/or laboratory reporting limits, with a maximum

were observed in “downgradient” perched zone monitoring well MW -11 in 1999 prior to the well 
going dry ( Ref. 11, p. 85; Ref. 9, p.138).

Observed Release to Exposition Aquifer Monitoring Wells 
Background Exposition Aquifer Monitoring Well 
In order to establish an observed release by chemical analysis in accordance with the HRS , an 
appropriate background well was selected that was hydrologically upgradient of Source 1, with a 
similar depth, screening interval, and construction of the contaminated release well downgradient 
of SWMNU -11 (Source 1 ). Monitoring well MW -12D, screened within the Exposition aquifer, is 
located upgradient of SWMU -11 and was identified as an ideal background well candidate. As 
shown on the table below , MW -12D has a sim ilar depth, screened interval, and construction as 
downgradient release well MW -11D (Ref. 11, p .225-232, 233 -241; Ref.7, p.82 ).

 EXIDE TECHNOLOGIES -VERNON 
As documented in the 1990 RFA, TCE was used as a cooling medium where it was poured into an 
open storage vat during the metals extrusion process where releases reportedly occurred 
throughout the lifespan of the unit . Based on current conditions and previous environmental 
investigations, it is believed that the contamination found beneath SWMU -11 originated from 
surface releases of TCE (Ref. 8, p.6, 44; Ref. 9, p.34; Ref. 10, p.313 -316; Ref. 11, p.85 ; Ref. 12, 
p.12).
Soil and soil vapor samples collected from SWMU -11 indicated elevated concentrations of TCE 
in soil to a depth of 70 feet bgs, and in soil vapor to a depth of 68 feet bgs (Ref. 9, p.92; Ref. 12, 
p.35-37). A dissolved phase fraction entered the groundwater and began to slowly migrate south -
southeast with the hydraulic gradient. Based on the geology underlying SWMU -11, it appears that
upon release, the TCE migrated vertically through approximately 75 feet of unsaturated sediments
over time (Ref. 12, p.12).
As discussed in Section 2.2.2 and shown on Figure A -5 of this HRS documentation record, two 
monitoring wells (PW -2 and MW -14) installed beneath SWMU -11 and one well immediately 
downgradient of SWMU -11 (MW -11) have been sampled since 1996. The maximum docum ented 
TCE concentration of 5,500 µg/L was observed at PW -2 in August 2000 (Ref. 9, pp. 138, 141, 
144). The maximum documented TCE concentration of 2,500 µg/L was observed at MW -14 in 
May 1999 ( Ref. 9, p. 141). The maximum documented TCE concentration of 2, 500 µg/L was 
observed at MW -11 in September 1999 ( Ref. 9, p. 138). 
An Exposition aquifer monitoring well (MW -11D) immediately downgradient of SWMU -11 has 
been sampled since 2015, with a maximum TCE concentration of 200 μg/L observed in December 
2015 ( Ref. 11, p. 146; Ref. 38, p. 35). An Exposition aquifer monitoring well (MW -12D) 
immediately upgradient of SWMU -11 has been sampled since 2015, with a maximum TCE 
concentration of 22 μg/L observed in was observed in March 2018 (Ref. 47, p. 43). 
As discussed above, on -site sampling results collected in September 2021 were used to establish 
an observed release of TCE to the Exposition aquifer. TCE was reported in a duplicate sample 
from MW -11D at a concentration of 47 µg/L, which is considered significantly above (three times) 
background based on the result of 15 µg/L collected from well MW -12D during the same sampling 
event (Ref. 20, p. 41, 18; Ref. 25, p p. 14, 44, 46; Ref. 22, p. 47). 
The historical TCE concentration s at MW -11D have been consistently greater than concentrations 
at immediately upgradient well MW -12D, indicat ing a localized on -site TCE source beneath 
SWMU -11 impacting groundwater in the Exposition aquifer, separate from other on-site and off -
site sources potentially contributing to the TCE levels found in on -site wells. At least 10 known 
groundwater monitoring wells are located immediately adjacent to the Site. These include nearby 
eight Exposition aquifer wells associated with the former Honeywell Bandi ni site (now Baker 
Commodities) immediately east of the Exide Technologies – Vernon site , and two Exposition 
aquifer wells associated with the former Univar Solutions USA facility, located approximately 
0.75 miles northeast of the Exide Technologies – Vernon site (Ref. 11, p.87 -89, 98 , 99; Ref 22 
p.19, 66 ; Ref. 54, p.37; Ref. 55, p.35 ).

Former Honeywell Bandini Site (now Baker Commodities) 
4037 Bandini Boulevard, Vernon, California 
DTSC EnviroStor ID 19340780 
The former Honeywell Bandini site (now Baker Commodities) is situated immediately east 
of the Exide Technologies – Vernon facility and operated as a metals forming manufacturer 
from 1951 to 2002. Since 2002, the property has been used for storage and office space. 
Numerous investigations conducted since 1996 have identified TCE and other VOCs in 
groundwater, soil, and soil vapor, with the highest TCE concentrations found level within 
the northern portion of the property. Based on groundwater flow direction and historic 
sampling results, the TCE detected from the Honeywell Bandini source wells do not appear 
to be a major contributing factor to the observed release at SWMU -11 within the Exide 
Technologies – Vernon facility (Ref. 11, p p.88, 89; Ref. 54 p p.7-8, 13, 37 ; Ref. 74, p.1 ). 
Former Univar Solutions USA Inc. Facility 
4256 Noakes Street, Commerce , California 
DTSC EnviroStor ID 80001627 
The f ormer Univar Solutions USA facility located approximately 0.75 miles northeast of 
the Exide Technologies – Vernon facility operated as a chemical distribution, blending, 
and recycling facility from 1954 through 2000. Historical operations at the facility have 
impacted soil and groundwater with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including TCE. 
Subsurface investigations have bee n conducted beginning in 1985 to delineate the extent 
and nature of the contamination. TCE originating from the former Univar So lutions facility 
has likely contributed in part to elevated TCE concentrations at the Exide Technologies -
Vernon facility , as observed in MW -12D ( Ref. 11, pp.88, 98, 99; Ref. 55, pp.8, 12, 41; Ref. 
74, p.1 ) 
TCE was reported in the five Honeywell Bandini monitoring wells sampled in December 2021 at 
concentrations ranging from 28 µg/L to 140 µg/L, all of which are hydraulically cross -gradient 
from the Exide Technologies – Vernon facility (Ref. 54 p. 13, 14, 25-26, 37, 39). TCE was reported 
in the nearest Univar Solutions monitoring well in June 2021 at concentrations of 85 µg/L and 430 
(estimated) µg/L, hydraulically up -gradient from the Exide Technologies – Vernon facility (Ref. 
55, p.41, 44, 77; Ref. 74, p.1 ). 
TCE con tamination originating from the off-site former Honeywell Bandini and former Univar 
Solutions sources are potentially contributing to TCE levels found in the Exide Technologies – 
Vernon monitoring wells, as seen in the consistent historic levels documented in background well 
MW-12D; however, the documented TCE release at SWMU -11 (Source 1) appears to be impacting 
downgradient well MW -11D at levels s ignificantly greater than concentrations migrating from off -
site sources.

purveyors, serve an estimated apportioned population of 306,890.50 . Of these 5 2 wells , 17 wells
operated by eight purveyors were identified as having at least some portion of their screening
interval consistent with the depths of the Exposition through Jefferson hydrologic unit, which
serves an estimated population of 133,7 46.29 , as s hown in the table below (Ref. 33, p.1 -17; Ref.

system that serves a population of approximately 152,217 and includes 11 active wells and no 
known standby wells (Ref. 34, p.1 -2). The district obtains approximately 72 .2% of its drinking 
water from groundwater , the remaining 2 7.7% is composed of imported surface water and/or 
recycled water (Ref. 56, p.65) . No individual well or intake exceeds 40 % of the annual pumpage 
or capacity for the district (Ref. 69, p.1 -5). Nine of the 11 active wells maintained by the district 
are located within 4 miles of Source 1 ; however, only five of these wells (Well 10 -03, Well 22 -01, 
Well 39 -02, Well 62 -01, and Well 62 -02) are reported to potentially have screening intervals at 
depths consistent with the Exposition through Jefferson hydrologic unit ( Ref. 33, p.1 -5; Ref. 15,

Walnut Park Mutual Water Company 
The Walnut Park MWC operates a drinking water system that serves a population of approximately 
16,180 and includes three active wells and no known standby wells (Ref. 34, p.12) . The purveyor 
obtains 100% of its drinking water from groundwater; however, it does maintain a connection with 
the MWD for an emergency supply (Ref. 63, p.1) . One well (Well 11) is responsible for 
approximately 52% of the annual pumpage or for the district (Ref. 69, p.35 -36). All three of the 
active wells maintained by the purveyor ( Well 10, Well 11, and Well 12) are located within 4 miles 
of Source 1 and are all reported to have screening intervals at depths consistent with the Exposition 
through Jefferson hydrologic unit (Ref. 33, p.15 -17). 
Calculation: Well 11: 16,180 people x 0.52 (52%) = 8,413.6 people 
Well 10 : 16,180 people x 0.24 (24%) = 3,883.2 people 
Well 12: 16,180 people x 0.24 (24%) = 3,883.2 people 
Golden State Water Company -Florence/Graham 
The GSWC [formerly the SCWC], Florence/Graham district operates a drinking water system that 
serves a population of approximately 62,970 and includes seven active wells and no known 
standby wells (Ref. 34, p.6 -7). The district obtains approximately 98% of its drinking water from 
groundwater , the remaining 2% is composed of imported surface water and/or recycled water (Ref. 
59, p.32, 35) . No individual well or intake exceeds 40 % of the annual pumpage or capacity for the 
district (Ref. 69, p.12 -18). Four of t he seven of the active wells maintained by the district are 
located within 4 miles of Source 1 ; however, only three of these wells (Converse Well 01, Nadeau 
Well 03, Goodyear Well 04) are reported to have screening intervals at depths consistent with the 
Exposition through Jefferson hydrologic unit (Ref. 33, p.9 -11). 
Calculation: 62,970 people/ (7 wells + 1 surface water intake) = 7,871.25 people per well. 
Commerce -City Water Department 
The Commerce -CWD operates a drinking water system that serves a population of approximately 
4,203 and includes two active wells, and no known standby well s (Ref. 34, p.3) . The district obtains 
approximately 66.7% of its drinking water from groundwater , the remaining 33.3% is composed 
of purchased surface water and/or recycled water (Ref. 57, p.4) . No individual well or intake 
exceeds 40 % of the annual pumpage or capacity for the district (Ref. 69, p.8 -9). Both active wells 
maintained by the department are located within 4 m iles of Source 1; however, only one of these 
wells ( Well 04L ) is reported to have a screening interval at depths consistent with the Exposition 
through Jefferson hydrologic unit (Ref. 33, p. 6). 
Calculation: 4,203 people/( 2 wells + 1 surface water intake) = 1,401.00 people per well.

NATIONAL PRIORITIES LIST (NPL) 
***Proposed  NPL Site*** September  2024 
J.  H.  BAXTER  Eugene, Oregon  
Lane  Count y 
Site Location:
The J. H. Baxter site is a former wood treating facility located at 3494 Roosevelt Blvd. in Eugene, Lane County, 
Oregon. The approximately 32-acre facility is adjacent to two drainages, Roosevelt Channel and an unnamed drainage 
ditch, and is located in a mixed residential, commercial, and industrial zoned portion of the city of Eugene. 
 Site History: 
Wood treating operations began 
in 1943 and continued until the facility closure in January 2022. Due to violations of 
air and water quality permits, as well as hazardous waste violations and complaints of intense odors, the site has been 
under investigation since 1989 by the EPA and state and local agencies. The facility is currently owned by J. H. Baxter 
& Co.
 Site Contamination/Contaminants:  
Contamination is present in groundwater , sediments  and soils from historic operational practices and spills. Wood 
treating chemicals were also left in place in tanks, retorts , and other containers when facility operations halted in 2022. 
Sampling conducted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) and the EPA indicates that f acility and 
nearby residential property soils are contaminated with dioxins, arsenic, dieldrin, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene  
(DDE ), benzo(a)pyrene, cadmium, and lead.  Sediments in Roosevelt Channel  and an unnamed ditch are contaminated 
with dioxins, arsenic, dieldrin, DDE, benzo(a)pyrene, and cadmium.  Soil samples collected from residential properties 
identified concentrations of dioxin s above the EPA Residential R egional Screening Levels (RSLs) at 15 of the 26 
properties sampled.  Sediment samples collected downstream of the facility contained concentrations of metals above 
the respective Oregon DEQ  Risk-Based Concentration  up to three  miles downstream of the facility.  
 Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment : 
Contamination in facility and residential property soils may pose a threat to remaining workers, trespassers, and 
residents that include children. Areas of soil contamination at residential properties include areas used by residents for 
recreation, lawn and house maintenance, and gardening. Additionally, there is evidence of sediment contamination 
in Roosevelt Channel and an unnamed drainage ditch which pose potential risks to human health and downstream 
fisheries and wetlands. Fishing in the area including Roosevelt Channel is known to occur and consumption of fish 
may pose a risk to human health. Contaminated groundwater also presents concerns to the environment.
 Response Activities (to date) : 
As of May 2024, Oregon DEQ conducted  soil cleanup activities at seven nearby residential properties. The EPA 
initiated a time critical removal action in early August 2024 to remove bulk chemicals from tanks and piping.
 Need for NPL Listing: 
The state of Oregon referred the site to the EPA because of the contamination present at the J. H. Baxter wood-treatment 
facility. Other federal and state cleanup programs were evaluated, but no other program has the appropriate authorities  
or resources to address the site at this time. The EPA received a letter of support for placing this site on the NPL from 
the state of Oregon. 
[The description of the site (release) is based on information available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS. The description may 
change as additional information is gathered on the sources and extent of contamination. See 56 FR 5600, February 11, 1991, or subsequent 
FR notices.]

*The street address , coordinates, and contaminant locations presented in this HRS documentation record identify the 
general area where the Site is located . They represent one or more locations the U nited States Environmental 
Protection Agency ( EPA ) considers to be part of the Site based on the screening information EPA used to evaluate the 
Site for National Priorities List (NPL ) listing . EPA lists national priorities among the known "releases or threatened 
releases" of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, n ot precisely delineated boundaries . A Site is 
defined as where a hazardous substance has been "deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has otherwise come to be 
located." Generally, HRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release merely represent the initial determination that 
a certain area may need to be addressed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation , and 
Liability Act (CERCLA ). Accordingly, EPA contemplates that the preliminary description of facility boundaries at 
the time of scoring will be refined as more information is developed as to where the contamination has come to be 
located.

 SITE DESCRIPTION 
J. H. Baxter is a former wood -processing and treatment facility located at 3494 Roosevelt 
Boulevard , formerly 85 Baxter Street, in southwest Eugene, Lane County, Oregon (Figure 1 and 
Figure 2 of this HRS documentation record ; Ref. 5, p. 10; Ref. 18, p. 6 ). For HRS scoring purposes, 
the Site consists of the release of hazardous substances from wood -processing operations to two 
areas of observed contamination (AOCs) . 
Hazardous substances associated with the AOCs include dibenzo -p-dioxin (dioxin ) and 
dibenzofuran ( furan ) congeners, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenols, including 
pentachlorophenol (PCP), and metals, including cadmium, lead, and zinc (see Section 5.1 of this 
HRS documentation record, General Considerations ). Two AOCs are documented , AOC A is a 
portion of the former facility property and AOC B is in the adjacent residential neighborhood 
immediately to the north , with approximately 109 residents within AOC B subject to Level I or 
Level II concentrations (see Section s 5.1 and 5.1. 1.3 of this HRS doc umentation record). 
The J. H. Baxter facility is bordered t o the north by Roosevelt Boulevard, Roosevelt Channel, and 
a residential neighborhood ( Figure s 2 and 3B of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 5, p. 10). 
Residential properties are located immediately to the north of Roosevelt Boulevard and Roosevelt 
Channel (Ref. 12, p. 34). The neighborhood north of the facility was developed in the 1950s (Ref 
12, p. 17). The southern border of the facility is formed by the Union Pacific Railroad right -of-
way (Ref. 4, p. 10 ). Industrial businesses surround the facility, with a metal recycling facility on 
the eastern boundary and plating, aviation, and lumber mill facilities to the west (Ref. 4, p. 10; 
Ref. 5, p. 10 ; Ref. 16, p. 7 ; Ref. 93, pp. 1 -3). The J. H. Baxter facility has been as large as 42.45 
acres (Ref. 5, p. 10 ; Ref. 12, p. 17), but was reduced to 31.5 acres by 2019 (Ref. 6, p. 9). 
Facility History 
Before construction of the J. H. Baxter facility in 1943, the property was undeveloped farmland 
(Ref. 6, p. 10 ; Ref. 7 , p. 18 ; Ref. 12, p. 17 ; Ref. 14 , p. 11). Operations at the facility consisted of 
wood treating in retorts using a variety of preservative chemicals, including cr eosotes, PCP, metal -
based solutions, and fire retardants (Ref . 5, pp. 13-18; Ref. 10 , pp. 3-4; Ref. 14 , p. 5; Ref. 15, p. 
17; Ref. 15, p. 57 ; Ref. 16, p. 9 ). After raw wood products were treated in the retorts, they were 
transported via tram to concrete drip pads where the treated wood was allowed to dry until no 
further drippage occurred. Following drying on the drip pad, treated wood products were either 
stored on one of several treated wood -storage areas on facility property, or transported elsewhere 
by truck or rail (Ref. 7, p. 20 ; Ref. 15, p. 18 ). The facility began with one retort, ultimately 
expanding to five before the facility was “mothballed” in early 2022, ceasing wood -treatment 
operations and only performing essential maintenance and environmental compliance (Ref. 5, p. 
13; Ref. 8, p. 1 ). 
Historical records describe a burn pit, 40 square feet in area and 4 feet deep, in the southwest 
portion of the facility that was used for the disposal of waste between 1945 and 1955. Oil sludge 
was added to the pit via 55 -gallon drums and a pipeline coming from the process area . The pit was 
excavated and filled in 1955, and a still -standing dry shed was constructed on the excavation 
footprint (Ref. 5, p. 19 ; Ref. 6, p. 11 ; Ref. 7, p. 18 ; Ref. 10, p. 4 ; Ref. 15, p. 16 ). There are no 
known records documentin g whether the excavated fill was removed from the property (Ref. 5, p. 
19; Ref. 7, p. 18, Ref. 15, p. 16 ). Later records indicate that hazardous waste was stored at the 
facility in the main treatment area. A designated hazardous waste storage shed was constructed in 
that area in 1982 and still stands today (Ref. 5, p. 20 ; Ref. 12, p. 18 ; Ref. 16, p. 10).

       The retorts were situated on pavement and diked (Ref. 5, p. 13; Ref. 6, p. 11; Ref. 7, p. 19; Ref. 12, 
p.19). However, approximately 80% of the rest of the facility is unpaved  (Ref. 6, p.  11; Ref. 7,
p. 19; Ref. 12, p. 19). Before 1976, most of the stormwater runoff from the facility went into the
ground, with some runoff going into drainage ditches to the north and south (Ref. 7, p. 20; Ref. 15,
p.18). Subsequently,  most  of the surface  runoff  on the facility  was  routed  to and  stored  in a
retention pond in the southwest corner of the property, which, after some aeration and skimming,
was transferred  to a drainage  ditch,  ultimately  connecting  to the A-3  drainage  channel  in the
Amazon Creek watershed (Ref. 5, p. 22). A stormwater treatment system began operations in 1997
(Ref. 15, p. 30; Ref. 18, p. 12). The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) and J.
H.Baxter  entered  into a consent  order  in 1989 after  groundwater  contamination  from  facility
operations  was found (Ref.  10, p. 6).  A groundwater  treatment  system  was  installed  in 1993 to
extract  and remove contaminants,  preventing  continuing  migration  of contaminated water  off of
the facility (Ref. 15, p. 29).
Since 1981,  the J.  H. Baxter  facility  has been  subject  to numerous  regulatory  investigations  and 
actions during its operation and after its closure (Ref. 5, p. 26; Ref. 6, pp. 13-14; Ref. 7, pp. 27-28, 
37-39; Ref. 15, op. 21, 24; Ref. 16, p. 12). In 2007, a 10-acre interim remedial action measure soil
cap was installed  throughout  the eastern  third  of the property,  to mitigate  airborne  transport  of
contaminated soil away from the facility (Ref. 6, p. 11; Ref. 7 pp. 19, 44; Ref. 15, p. 32; Ref. 18,
pp. 6, 11).  Since  1977, when  the first  air quality  complaint  was recorded,  residents  of the
neighborhoods to the north and northeast of the facility reported numerous complaints to the Lane
Regional Air Protection Agency (LRAPA) concerning odor and symptoms of illness (Ref. 59, p.
14; Ref. 88, p. 5, 7, 10) . The number of air quality complaints peaked in 2004, w ith 762 complaints
recorded (Ref. 88, p. 7).
A notice  of violation  (NOV)  was  issued  to J. H. Baxter  in 2017 by EPA,  after an investigation 
found Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) violations at the facility (Ref. 13). These 
violations included lack of curbs or berms surrounding the retorts; failure to minimize tracking of 
product off of the drip pad; failure to hold wood on the drip pad until drippage is complete; failure 
to conduct  weekly  inspections  of the drip pad;  failure  to properly  label  containers;  disposal  of 
hazardous  waste  without  a permit;  failure  to comply  with land disposal  restriction  treatment 
standards; and treatment and storage of hazardous wastes without a permit (Ref. 13, pp. 1-5). The 
2017 NOV indicates  that J. H. Baxter  is a significant  non-complier  (Ref. 13,  p. 6). In  2020 and 
2021, a consultant hired by J. H. Baxter collected soil samples near the facility and in residential 
properties.  Results  identified  elevated  levels  of dioxins  above  ODEQ  residential  soil risk-based 
concentration (4.7 parts per trillion [ppt]) in six residential yards out of seven sampled, with three 
yards exceeding 40 ppt of dioxins (Ref. 17, pp. 1-2). 
In 2019, DEQ issue d a Rec ord of Decisi on (ROD ) that require d clea nup a t the facilit y as well as 
off-facilit y soil sampl ing. I n Janua ry 2022, ODE Q issue d the facilit y a sc ope of wor k including 
the residentia l soil reme dial eleme nts prescribe d by the 2019 ROD . A wee k later, the company 
president indica ted that the facilit y would not be a ble to comple te the require d actions due to 
financ ial limitations . The state was notifie d by the c ompany pre sident of their decisio n to 
‘mothball ’ the facilit y, suspe nding all wood treat ment operati ons, while maintaining a skeleton 
crew to overse e the groundwater , stormwater , and proce ss wa ter treatme nt syste ms (Re f. 17, p. 2). 
ODEQ issue d a subseque nt Orpha n Site declaratio n for J. H. Baxte r & C o., making the company 
eligible for remediation funding through the state and federal government (Ref. 17, pp. 1-2) . 
ODEQ has completed soil removals at seven residential properties located to the north of the 
facility. The properties with removals were not included in population counts or hazardous waste
quantity values for AOC B (Ref. 41, pp. 10, 30; section 5.1.0 AOC B of this HRS documentation 
record).

      4.0 SURFACE WATER MIGRATION PATHWAY 
The Surface Water Migration Pathway was not scored, as its inclusion does not affect the listing 
decision. The Surface Water Migration Pathway is, however, a concern to EPA. 
The J. H. Baxter facility is located within the Amazon Creek watershed. The Amazon Creek 
watershed has been modified extensively over the years through a series of manmade ditches and 
channels (Ref. 4, p. 62 -63; Ref. 5, pp. 21 -22). Stormwater treatment system and groundwater 
treatment system outflow from the J. H. Baxter facility discharge to Roosevelt Channel a nd its 
tributaries, located adjacent to the north of the facility (Ref. 4, pp. 60 -61). Roosevelt Channel flows 
to the A3 channel, approximately 1 mile downstream of the facility. The A3 channel flows 1.24 
miles to Amazon Creek. From Amazon Creek, it is a f urther 12.32 miles to the confluence with 
Clear Lake, and an additional 1.05 miles to the confluence with the Long Tom River. An additional 
diversion channel exists on Amazon Creek, 330 feet south of the A3 channel confluence. During 
a high water event, it is possible that surface water entering Amazon Creek from the A3 channel 
may backflow into the diversion channel. The Amazon Creek diversion channel flows for 3.81 
miles until it reaches the Fern Ridge Reservoir, which continues for 3.4 miles to the confl uence 
with the Long Tom River (Ref. 4, p. 62 -63). 
From 1955 to 1981, the annual mean flow rate for Amazon Creek ranged from 17.4 cubic feet per 
second (cfs) to 54 cfs. More recent gaging data was not available (Ref. 81). USGS gaging data was 
not available for Roosevelt Channel A3 Channel, and Amazon Creek Diversion Channel. From 
2014 to 2024, annual mean flow rate to Long Tom River at the outfall from Fern Ridge Lake 
ranged from 299.4 cfs to 751.9 cfs (Ref. 80). 
2023 EPA IA Sampling 
EPA tasked Weston , under START Contract No. 68HE0720D005 and TO 68HE0722F0059, to 
conduct an IA at the J. H. Baxter site (Ref. 4, p. 9). Sampling was conducted under an 
EPA -approved site -specific SAP (Ref. 4, p. 19; Ref. 9). As part of the IA, sediment samples were 
collected in May 2023. Sediment samples were collected from Amazon Creek and its unnamed 
tributaries, Roosevelt Channel, South Channel, and Amazon Creek Diversion Channel (Ref. 4, pp. 
20, 44). Samples were submitted for off -site fixed laboratory analysis for TAL VOCs, TAL 
SVOCs, TAL Pesticides, TAL Aroclors, and TAL Inorganics, using CLP SOW SFAM01.1 
methodology for all analyses (Ref. 4, p. 19 -20, 25). Some predetermined locations were also 
analyzed for dioxins and furans using CLP SOW HRSM02.1, Total Organic Carbon using PSEP -
TOC -M, and grain size (Ref. 4, pp. 20, 25). Dioxin/furan congeners and metals were detected in 
sediments collected from downstrea m of the J. H. Baxter facility (Ref. 4, pp. 82 -84, 571 -585). 
Surface Water Targets 
No drinking water intakes are located within 15 miles downstream of the J. H. Baxter facility (Ref. 
4, p. 63). During the 2023 IA sampling event, a resident informed EPA that crawfish caught in 
Amazon Creek had been fished and consumed “regularly” during the summer months (Ref. 4, p. 
399). Online message boards also indicate that fishing occurs in Amazon Creek, Amazon Creek 
Diversion Channel, Fern Ridge Reservoir, and Clear Lake. Rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ), 
largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ), bluegill ( Lepomis macrochirus ), crappie ( Pomoxis sp. ), 
common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) and yellow bullhead ( Ameiurus natalis ) are species reportedly

  5.0 SOIL EXPOSURE AND SUBSURFACE INTRUSION PATHWAY 
5.1 SOIL EXPOSURE COMPONENT 
Two areas of observed contamination (AOCs) attributable to the J. H. Baxter site were evaluated for 
scoring . Descriptions of the individual areas, with reference citations, are provided in the sections below. 
AOC A is the Facility Contaminated Soil, measuring approximately 714,744 square feet on the facility. 
AOC B is the Residential Contaminated Soil, measuring approximately 454,604 square feet within the 
neighborhood to the north of the facility . Hazardous substances associated with these AOCs include dioxin 
and furan congeners, metals, pesticides, and SVOCs. Detailed information about hazardous substances 
and hazardous waste quantities in each source, with reference citations, is available in Section 5.1.0 of 
this HRS documentation record . 
Approximately 109 residents occupy residential properties within AOC B (Tables 21 and 22 of this HRS 
documentation record) .

 5.1.0 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Letter by which this AOC is to be identified : A 
Name of AOC : Facility Contaminated Soil 
AOC Type : Contaminated Soil 
Location and description of area ( see Figure 3 A of this HRS documentation record ): 
AOC A consists of contaminated soil within the J. H. Baxter facility property (Tables 2 through 4 and 
Figure 3A of this HRS documentation record). Soil contamination was a result of historical operations as 
a wood -treatment facility . Operations at the facility included high -pressure wood treating in retorts using 
a variety of preservative chemicals, including PCP, ACZA, 50/50 Heavy Oil Blends of Creosote and 
Bunker C Oil (50/50), Creosote, and Alkaline Copper Quaternary -Type B (ACQ) (Ref. 5, pp. 13 -18; Ref. 
10, pp. 3 -4; Ref. 14, p. 5; Ref. 15, pp. 17, 57; Ref. 16, p. 9; Ref. 87, pp. 9 ). After raw wood products were 
treated in the retorts, they were transported via tram to concrete drip pads where the treated wood was 
allowed to dry until no further drippage occurred. After drying on the drip pad, treated wood products 
were either stored o n one of several on -property treated wood -storage areas or transported off -property by 
truck or rail (Ref. 7, pp. 20, 40; Ref. 15, p. 18 ; Ref. 87, p. 11 ). 
In 2017, EPA issued J.H. Baxter & Co. a NOV detailing eight RCRA violations found during an inspection 
in 2014. Several of the violations were related to hazardous materials interacting with soil due to 
inadequate drip pad infrastructure and maintenance associated with the retorts, which are located within 
AOC A . The EPA inspector observed several such instances, noting that “ [i]n some areas, the oily 
substance, waste wood preservative (EPA hazardous wastes numbers F032 and F034) , had stained and 
soaked into the soil, a nd in other areas the hazardous waste (waste wood preservative) was pooled on the 
soil surface.” In two other instances, the inspector noted PCP leakage from a pump hose and a pipe 
connected to a PCP storage tank. The releases were deemed “disposals,” and the facility was cited for 
disposal of hazardous waste without a permit and for failure to comply with Land Disposal Restrictions 
treatment standards. Based on the severity of these violations, the NOV classified the J. H. Baxter facility 
as a “significant non-complier” (Figure 2 and Figure 3A of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 13, pp. 
1-6).
Based on the soil sampling described below , AOC A was measured based on samples with concentrations 
significantly above background. AOC A measures approximately 714,744 square feet (see Figure 3A of 
this HRS documentation record). 
AOC A is documented below based on the 2023 EPA IA soil sampling event. Contaminated samples are 
compared to background samples collected during the same sampling event using the same field and 
analytical methods (Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 4, pp. 17 -18). 
Background locations are shown on Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record. Contaminated samples 
used to document AOC A are shown on Figure 3A of his HRS documentation record. Grab surface soil 
sampling for the IA was conducted by START on the J. H. Baxter facility and on residential properties in 
2023 (Ref. 4, pp. 17, 19) .

  EPA IA 2023 Site Assessment Surface Soil Samples 
EPA tasked Weston Solutions, Inc. (Weston), under START Contract Number (No.) 68HE0720D005 and 
Task Order (TO) 68HE0722F0059, to conduct an IA of the J. H. Baxter site (Ref. 4, p. 9). Sampling was 
conducted under an EPA -approved site -specific Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) (Ref. 4, p. 19; Ref. 
9). AOC A sampling was conducted in May 2023 (Ref. 4, pp. 17, 19). 
Sample locations are presented on Figure 3A and Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record. In May 
2023, twelve surface soil field samples were collected at the J. H. Baxter facility from 0 to 6 inches bgs. 
Two background soil samples were collected for comparison to the contaminated soils (Ref. 4, p. 20). 
Background locations included two public parks in Eugene, Oregon, located ¾ -mile northwest and 2 ¼ -
miles south o f the facility (Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 4, p. 19). Samples were 
colle cted as grab samples from 0 to 6 inches bgs using a non -dedicated hand auger, which was 
decontaminated after each use (Ref. 4, p. 17 -18). 
Samples were submitted for off -site fixed laboratory analysis for TAL VOCs (SFAM01.1), TAL SVOCs 
(SFAM01.1), TAL Pesticides (SFAM01.1), TAL Aroclors (SFAM 01.1), TAL Inorganics (SFAM 01.1), 
and dioxins/furans (HRSM02.1). All samples were analyzed under EPA CLP Statement of Work (SOW) 
SFAM01.1, with the exceptions of dioxins and furans which were analyzed under CLP SOW HRSM02.1 
(Ref. 4, pp. 19 -21, 25 -26). All sample analyses were validated following EPA’s Stage 4 Data Validation 
Electronic/Manual Process. A START chemist performed a Stage 1 verification of each CLP data package. 
(Ref. 4, p. 26). 
-Background Surface Soil
During the IA, background surface soils were collected from two locations not expected to be affected by
historical site operations. Sample JHB -S13 was collected from a public park ¾ -mile northwest believed
to be outside the influence of emissions sources at the J. H. Baxter facility. Sample JHB -S14 was collected
from a public park 2 ¼ -miles south of the facility and believed to be outside the influence of migrant dust
emissions from the J. H. Baxter facility (Ref. 4, p. 43).

U: The material was analyzed for but was not detected above the level of the associated value. The associated value 
is either the sample quantitation limit or the sample detection limit. (Ref. 60, p. 421) 
J: The associated value is an estimated quantity (Ref. 60, p. 421) 
Q: Concentration is below the CRQL but is above the method detection limit (Ref. 60, p. 421) 
*: Since the samples were analyzed through the CLP, the CRQLs presented above are equivalent to the CRQL as defined 
by the HRS (Ref. 1, Sections 1.1 and 2.3). 
The minimum standard to establish observed contamination by chemical analysis is analytical evidence 
of a hazardous substance significantly above the background level, and some portion of the significant 
increase above the background level is attributable to the Site. In accordance with HRS Table 2 -3, if the 
background concentration is not detected, a significant increase is established when the sample 
measurement equals or exceeds the SQL. If the SQL cannot be established, if the sample analysis was 
perfor med under the EPA CLP, use the EPA CRQL in place of the SQL. If the sample analysis is not 
performed under the EPA CLP, use the detection limit (DL) in place of the SQL . If the background 
concentration equals or exceeds the detection limit, a significant increase is established when the sample 
measurement is three times or more above the background concentration (Ref. 1, Section 2.3).

Q: Concentration is below the CRQL but is above the method detection limit (Ref. 60, p. 421). Results that are 
qualified due to detection at or above the detection limit but below the quantitation limit are not considered biased. 
The concentration is used without applying an adjustment factor (Ref. 50, pp. 6, 8).

  AOC A Hazardous Waste Quantity 
Hazardous Constituent Quantity (Tier A ) 
The hazardous constituent quantity for AOC A could not be adequately determined according to the HRS 
requirements; that is, the total mass of all CERCLA hazardous substances in the source and releases from 
the source is not known and cannot be estimated with reasonable confidence (Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.1 ). 
There are i nsufficient historical and current data ( manifests, potentially responsible party [PRP] records, 
state records, permits, waste concentration data, etc. ) available to adequately calculate the total or partial 
mass of all CERCLA hazardou s substances in the source and the associated releases from the source. 
Therefore, there is insufficient information to calculate the h azardous constituent quantity for AOC A with 
reasonable confidence . Scoring proceeds to the evaluation of Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity (Ref. 
1, Section 2.4.2.1.1). 
Hazardous Constituent Quantity Value: Not Scored (NS) 
Hazardous Wastestream Quantit y (Tier B) 
The total Hazardous Wastestream Quantity for AOC A could not be adequately determined according to 
the HRS requirements; that is, the total mass, or a partial estimate, of all hazardous wastestreams and 
CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from the source is not known and cannot 
be estimated with reasonable confidence (Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.2). Insufficient historical and current data 
(permits, waste concentration data, annual reports, etc.) are available to adequately calculate the total 
mass, or a partial estimate, of all haza rdous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for 
the source and the associated releases from the source. Therefore, there is insufficient information to 
adequately calculate or extrapolate a total or partial Hazardous Wastestream Quantity for AOC A with 
reasonable confidence. Scoring proceeds to the evaluation of Tier C, volume (Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.3). 
Hazardous Wastestream Quantity Value: NS

Tier C, volum e is not applica ble to sourc e type contaminate d soil for the soil e xposure c omponent (Ref. 
1, Secti on 5.1.1.2.2) . 
Volume Assigned Value: 0 
Area (Tier D) 
The area of AOC A is estimated to be approximately 714,744 square feet, based on surface soil samples 
collected by EPA in 2023 during the IA with concentrations of hazardous substances that were 
significantly above background (see Figure 3A and Table s 2 through 4 of this HRS documentation record) . 
However, the area of AOC A is not considered to be adequately determined as the sampling was limited 
and not comprehensive across the full facility ; due to the likely varying modes of deposition of hazardous 
substances at the facility, soil contamination is not inferred throughout AOC A . In addition, an 
undetermined portion of AOC A is beneath buildings, roads, or other impervious covers . Therefore, the 
area of AOC A is greater than 0 but unknown.

  5.1.0 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Letter by which this AOC is to be identified : B 
Name of AOC : Residential Contaminated Soil 
AOC Type : Contaminated Soil 
Location and description of area : 
AOC B consists of contaminated soil within the residential neighborhood north of the J. H. Baxter facility 
(Figure 3B of this HRS documentation record). Soil contamination was a result of historical operations of 
J. H. Baxter as a wood -treatment facility. Operations at the facility included high -pressure wood treating 
in retorts using a variety of preservative chemicals, including PCP, ACZA, 50/50 Heavy Oil Blends of 
Creosote and Bunker C Oil (50/50), Creosote, and ACQ (Ref. 5, pp. 13 -18; Ref. 10, pp. 3 -4; Ref. 14, p. 5; 
Ref. 15, pp. 17, 57; Ref. 16, p. 9; Ref. 87, pp. 9 ). After raw wood produ cts were treated in the retorts, they 
were transported via tram to concrete drip pads where the treated wood was allowed to dry until no further 
drippage occurred. After drying on the drip pad, treated wood products were either stored on one of several 
on-property treated wood -storage areas or transported off -property by truck or rail (Ref. 7, pp. 20, 40; Ref. 
15, p. 18; Ref. 87, p. 11). 
Seasonal downwind direction from the facility is northward toward the residential neighborhood (Ref. 39, 
p.33; Ref. 59, pp. 3, 14, 16, 35; Ref. 92, p. 1). In 2007 , LRAPA completed an air sampling study in
response to community concerns regarding emissions from J. H. Baxter. The study was designed to
measure maximum downwind exposures in the neighborhoods nearest to the J. H. Baxter facility adjacent
to the north, northeast and northwest. The process at the J. H. Baxter facility that generated the majority
of the off-property emissions used mixtures of creosote, oil and PCP to treat wood products for
preservation. The various stages of treatment operations were performed in drying kilns and large retorts
using pressure and vacuum. Emissions occurred from many points, including vacuum pumps, tank vents,
retort door openings, and treated product storage (Ref. 59, pp. 1, 3).
Detections of hazardous substances related to plant processes correlated well with downwind exposure. 
None of the facility -related hazardous substances were ever detected in samples that had no downwind 
exposure (Ref. 59, pp. 6, 9). LRAPA staff documented operations -related odors on the facility and in the 
neighborhood to the north during many of the air sampling events as part of the 2005 -2006 study. Resident 
complaints were received during these times and confirmed by LRAPA staff (Ref. 59, pp. 25 -27, 29 -34). 
Based on the soil sampling described below , AOC B was measured based on samples with concentrations 
significantly above background. The area of contaminated soil measures approximately 454,604 square 
feet (see Figure 3B of this HRS documentation record).

  AOC B is documented below based on four soil sampling events conducted by J. H. Baxter, ODEQ, and 
EPA in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Contaminated samples are compared to background samples collected 
during the same sampling events using the same field and analyt ical methods. Background locations are 
shown on Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record. Contaminated samples used to document AOC B 
are shown on Figure 3B of this HRS documentation record. ISM soil sampling was conducted at 
residential properties by J. H. Baxter and ODEQ in 2021 and 2022 (Ref. 39, p. 7; Ref. 92, pp. 1 -2; Ref. 
118, pp. 9, 11 -12, 14) . As part of the EPA IA, ISM soil sampling was conducted by the EPA START on 
residential properties in 2022 (Ref. 4, p. 17) . ISM soil sampling was conducted by START at additional 
residential properties in 2023 (Ref. 4, p. 17) . Grab surface soil sampling for the IA was conducted by 
START on the J. H. Baxter facility and on residential properties in 2023 (Ref. 4, p p. 9, 17, 19 ). 
J. H. Baxter and ODEQ 2021 -2022 ISM Surface Soil Sampling 
In 2021, J. H. Baxter conducted characterization of dioxin and furan concentrations in surface soils at 
eight properties suspected to be affected by air emissions deposition from the J. H. Baxter facility (Ref. 
39, p. 7; Ref. 92, pp. 1 -2; Ref. 118, pp. 9, 11-12, 14). Elevated dioxin and furan concentrations were 
identified in soil samples collected from residential yards immediately north of the facility (Ref. 118, p. 
12). Concentrations were highest in yards within areas where air deposition modeling compl eted by 
LRAPA predicted predominant summer wind direction and deposition areas from the facility (Ref. 92, pp. 
1-2; Ref. 118, p. 12).
In January 2022, J. H. Baxter notified ODEQ it would not be able to implement cleanup at the residential 
yards in a timely manner, and suspended wood treatment activities at its facility. ODEQ subsequently 
declared the facility an Orphan Site to enable uti lization of the Industrial Orphan Site Account to complete 
Removal Assessments at the residential yards (Ref. 118, pp. 9, 12). In June 2022, ODEQ implemented 
investigation of five additional residential properties (Ref. 118, pp. 1, 9, 13). 
Samples were collected in background and residential DUs using ISM (Ref. 4, pp. 79 -81; Ref. 39, pp. 9 -
10; Ref. 117; Ref. 118, pp. 11 -13, 15 -17, 22). ISM samples were analyzed for metals, PAHs/PCP, and/or 
dioxins/furans (Ref. 39. pp. 10, 15 -16, 33-34; Ref. 118, pp. 11 -13, 22). Sampling locations are shown on 
Figure 3B.

          The minimum standard to establish observed contamination by chemical analysis is analytical evidence 
of a hazardous substance significantly above the background level , and some portion of the significant 
increase above the background level is attributable to the Site. In accordance with HRS Table 2 -3, if the 
background concentration is not detected, a significant increase is established when the sample 
measurement equals or exceeds the Sample Quantitation Limit (SQL ). If the SQL cannot be established, 
if the sample analysis was performed under the EPA CLP, use the EPA CRQL in place of the SQL. If the 
sample analysis is not performed under the EPA CLP, use the detection limit (DL) in place of the SQL if 
the background concentration equals or exceeds the detection limit, a significant increase is established 
when the sample measurement is three times or more above the background concentration (Ref. 1, Section 
2.3).

2022 and 2023 EPA Integrated Assessment (IA) Sampling 
EPA tasked Weston Solutions, Inc. (Weston), under START Contract Number (No.) 68HE0720D005 and 
Task Order (TO) 68HE0722F0059, to conduct an IA at the J. H. Baxter site (Ref. 4, p. 9). Sampling was 
conducted under an EPA -approved site -specific Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) (Ref. 4, p. 19; Ref. 
9). AOC B sampling was conducted in May 2022, March 2023, and May 2023 (Ref. 4, pp. 17, 19). 
EPA IA 2023 Site Assessment Surface Soil Samples 
EPA tasked Weston Solutions, Inc. (Weston), under START Contract Number (No.) 68HE0720D005 and 
Task Order (TO) 68HE0722F0059, to conduct an IA of the J. H. Baxter site (Ref. 4, p. 9). Sampling was 
conducted under an EPA -approved site -specific Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP) (Ref. 4, p. 19; Ref. 
9). AOC A sampling was conducted in May 2023 (Ref. 4, pp. 17, 19). 
Sample locations are presented on Figure 3B and Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record. In May 
2023, 26 surface soil field samples were collected from 0 to 6 inches bgs at residential properties north of 
the J. H. Baxter facility across Roosevelt Boulevard . Two background soil samples were collected for 
comparison to the contaminated soils (Ref. 4, p. 20). Background locations included two public parks in 
Eugene, Oregon, located ¾ -mile northwest and 2 ¼ -miles south of the facility (Figure 4 of this HRS 
docu mentation record; Ref. 4, p. 19). Samples were collected as grab samples from 0 to 6 inches bgs using 
a non -dedicated hand auger, which was decontaminated after each use (Ref. 4, p. 17 -18). 
Samples were submitted for off -site fixed laboratory analysis for TAL VOCs (SFAM01.1), TAL SVOCs 
(SFAM01.1), TAL Pesticides (SFAM01.1), TAL Aroclors (SFAM 01.1), TAL Inorganics (SFAM 01.1), 
and dioxins/furans (HRSM02.1). All samples were analyzed under EPA CLP Statement of Work (SOW) 
SFAM01.1, with the exceptions of dioxins and furans which were analyzed under CLP SOW HRSM02.1 
(Ref. 4, pp. 19 -21, 25 -26). All sample analyses were validated following EPA’s Stage 4 Data Validation

(Ref. 4, p. 26). 
-Background Surface Soil
During the IA, background surface soils were collected from two locations not expected to be affected by
historical site operations. Sample JHB -S13 was collected from a public park ¾ -mile northwest believed
to be outside the influence of emissions sources at the J. H. Baxter facility. Sample JHB -S14 was collected
from a public park 2 ¼ -miles south of the facility and believed to be outside the influence of migrant dust
emissions from the J. H. Baxter facility (Ref. 4, p. 43). Background soils were medium -dark brown, mostly
silt and clay with some gravel (Ref. 4, p. 397).

U: The material was analyzed for but was not detected above the level of the associated value. The associated value 
is either the sample quantitation limit or the sample detection limit. (Ref. 60, p. 421) 
J: The associated value is an estimated quantity (Ref. 60, p. 421) 
Q: Concentration is below the CRQL but is above the method detection limit (Ref. 60, p. 421). Results that are 
qualified due to detection at or above the detection limit but below the quantitation limit are not considered biased. 
The concentration is used without applying an adjustment factor (Ref. 50, pp. 6, 8).

*: Since the samples were analyzed through the CLP, the CRQLs presented above are equivalent to the CRQL as 
defined by the HRS (Ref. 1, Sections 1.1 and 2.3). 
EPA IA 2022 Removal Site Evaluation (RSE) ISM Surface Soil Samples 
In April 2022, EPA initially tasked START with evaluating 30 properties by collecting soil samples to be 
analyzed for dioxins and furans, as part of a Removal Site Evaluation (RSE). The scope of the RSE 
included collecting soil samples from residential pro perties in the neighborhood north of the facility, 
analyzing those samples, then reporting the results to EPA and ODEQ. EPA worked with ODEQ to 
identify the properties to evaluate. After agreeing on the initial 30 properties, EPA and START conducted 
RSE fi eld activities from May 23, 2022, through May 27, 2022 (Ref. 4, p. 17). 
START collected samples following the ISM. START collected increments of soil to a depth of six inches 
below ground surface (bgs) and from 30 -75 increments within each Decision Unit (DU). The exact number 
of increments was determined by the EPA on site. Fo r the May 2022 sampling, each property was divided 
into DUs based upon features of the property, and each sample was identified as either a Front Yard, 
Backyard, Side Yard, or Garden Area. Soil samples were collected from each of these DUs and submitted 
to the laboratory for analysis (Ref. 4, p. 17). During the May 2022 sampling effort, an ISM Whole Yard 
sample was collected from 0 -6 inch es bgs. Additionally, one 5 -point composite sample was collected from 
each DU from 0 -3 inches bgs (Ref. 4, p. 18). 
At the end of the project, samples were shipped to an analytical laboratory for ISM processing and 
chemical analysis (Ref. 4, p. 18). The subcontracted analytical laboratory dried, sieved, and processed 
each sample according to ISM. After processing, the s amples were analyzed for dioxins and furans using 
EPA Method 1613B (Ref. 4, p. 18). 
-2022 Background Surface Soil
Background location JHB -33-WY was collected from Residence ID 52 (Ref. 51; Figure 4 of this HRS
documentation record). This location was selected to represent background concentrations for the 2022
ISM sampling as it was the residence located furthest to t he east and was not directly north of the facility,
so was less likely to have received airborne contaminated soil or emissions from the J. H. Baxter facility
(Ref. 39, p. 33; Ref. 59, pp. 3, 16, 35 ; Ref. 92, p. 12).

EPA IA 2023 RSE ISM Surface Soil Samples 
After reviewing the results of the May 2022 field sampling event, EPA and ODEQ determined that 
additional properties should be evaluated. EPA and START conducted another round of residential soil 
sampling from March 6, 2023 , through March 16, 2023, which included evaluation of an additional 22 
properties (Ref. 4, p. 17). 
START collected samples following the ISM. START collected increments of soil to a depth of six inches 
bgs and from 30 -75 increments within each DU. The exact number of increments was determined by the 
EPA on site. During the 2023 sampling effort, each pro perty was broken up into two DUs, called Front 
Yard and Backyard, and a 0 -6-inch bgs ISM sample was collected from each of those DUs. The difference 
in approach for ISM samples was directed by EPA and ODEQ. Soil samples were collected from each of 
these DU s and submitted to the laboratory for analysis (Ref. 4, p. 17). Additionally, one 5 -point composite 
sample was collected from each DU from 0 -3 inches bgs (Ref. 4, p. 18). Sample locations are shown on 
Figure 3B and Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record.

   Each increment within a DU was composited into a sample bag. Upon completion of the ISM sample, the 
5-point composite sample was collected and placed into a separate bag. Once all samples were collected
from a property, the samples were returned to the com mand post for sample processing and placed in a
sample cooler. At the end of the project, samples were shipped to an off -site analytical laboratory for ISM
processing and chemical analysis (Ref. 4, p. 18). The subcontracted analytical laboratory dried, sie ved,
and processed each sample according to ISM. After processing, the samples were analyzed for dioxins
and furans using EPA Method 1613B (Ref. 4, p. 18).
-2023 Background Surface Soil
Background samples JHB -02-FY, JHB -57-FY, JHB -57-BY, JHB -59-BY, and JHB -59-FY were collected
from Residence IDs 53, 55, and 54, respectively ( Ref. 4, pp. 30, 32; Ref. 51; Figure 4 of this HRS
documentation record). These locations were selected to represent background concentrations for the 2023
ISM sampling as they were located furthest to the east beyond properties with lower concentrations during
the 2022 sampli ng and not directly downwind of the retort area ( Figure 2, Figure 3B, and Figure 4 of this
HRS documentation record; Ref. 4, pp. 74 -75, 78, 86; Ref. 39, p. 33; Ref. 59, pp. 3, 16, 35).

Hazardous Wastestream Quantity (Tier B) 
The total Hazardous Wastestream Quantity for AOC B could not be adequately determined according to 
the HRS requirements; that is, the total mass, or a partial estimate, of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from the source is not known and cannot be estimated with reasonable confidence (Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.2). Insufficient historical and current data (permits, waste concentration data, annual reports, etc.) are available to adequately calculate the total mass, or a partial estimate, of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and the associated releases from the source. Therefore, there is insufficient information to adequately calculate or extrapolate a total or partial Hazardous Wastestream Quantity for AOC B with reasonable confidence. Scoring proceeds to the evaluation of Tier C, volume (Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.3). 
Hazardous Wastestream Quantity Value: NS 
Area (Tier D) 
The area of AOC B is estimated to be approximately 454,604 square feet, based on surface soil samples collected by ODEQ in 2021 and by EPA in 2022 and 2023 during the IA with concentrations of hazardous substances that were at concentrations significantly above background (see Figure 3B, Tables 5 through 16 of this HRS documentation record.) However, the area of AOC B is not considered to be adequately determined as an undetermined portion of AOC B is beneath buildings, roads, or other impervious covers and seven properties within the AOC boundaries have undergone removal actions (Figure 3B of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 41, pp. 10, 30). Therefore, the area of AOC B is greater than 0 but unknown.

    Attribution of Observed Contamination in AOC A and AOC B to the J. H. Baxter Facility 
Facility Operations and Emissions 
J. H. Baxter operated as a wood -treatment facility from 1943 through 2022 (Ref. 6, p. 10; Ref. 7, p. 18; 
Ref. 8, p. 1; Ref. 12, p. 17; Ref. 14, p. 11). Operations at the facility included high -pressure wood treating 
in retorts using a variety of preservative chemicals, including PCP, ACZA, 50/50 Heavy Oil Blends of 
Creosote and Bunker C Oil (50/50), Creosote, and ACQ (Ref. 5, pp. 13 -18; Ref. 10, pp. 3 -4; Ref. 14, p. 5; 
Ref. 15, pp. 17, 57; Ref. 16, p. 9; Ref. 87, p. 9 ). After raw wood products were treated in retorts, they were 
transported to concrete drip pads where the treated wood was allowed to dry until no further drippage 
occurred. After drying on the drip pad, treated wood products were either stored on one of several on -site 
treated wood -storage areas, or transported off -site by truck or rail (Ref. 7, pp. 20, 40; Ref. 15, p. 18; Ref. 
87, p. 11). 
Vapors generated during the wood -treating process were routed to a condenser to remove liquid from the 
exhaust stream. Liquids removed by the condenser were routed to a hot well prior to flowing to a 
downstream collection sump. Process liquids collected in the sump were delivered to a recovery tank prior 
to entering the process water treatment system. The dried exhaust stream was routed to a knock -out drum 
prior to exhausting to atmosphere through the PCP stack. The dried exhaust stream during heavy oil 
charges were routed to a downstream air pollution control device for control of VOC emissions prior to 
emitting to atmosphere (Ref. 87, p. 10). 
Poor housekeeping, including pipe leakage, soil staining, pooling of hazardous waste on the soil surface, 
and failure to abide by odor abatement requirements have been noted during facility operations (Ref. 13, 
pp. 1 -6; Ref. 90, pp. 4 -5; Ref. 91, pp. 14 -15, 19, 23 -24, 26 -27). In 2014, an inspection was conducted at 
the J. H. Baxter facility using Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) technology and a Photoionization 
Detector (PID) to identify process gas releases. Gas releases were identified at multiple location s including 
the oil -water separators, cooling tower basin, process water clarifier and vault, creosote and PCP sumps, 
ACZA scrubber vent, condensate unit, retorts, and treated wood (Ref. 91, pp. 1 -2, 3-5, 31 -57). 
In 2021, J. H. Baxter collected multiple raw material and process water samples from the facility for 
analysis of dioxins and furans, PAHs, VOCs, ammonia, wood organics, and/or total metals (Ref. 85, p. 1; 
Ref. 87 , pp. 1 -2, 13 -15, 21, 24 -25). As shown in Table 17 of this HRS documentation record below, 
hazardous substances associated with AOC A and AOC B, including PCP, dioxins, furans, and PAHs, 
were detected in raw material and process water samples from the facility (Ref. 85, pp. 4 -7). 
The hazardous substances found at observed contamination concentrations in AOCs A and B include 
PAHs, PCP, dioxins, furans, and metals (see Tables 2 through 16 of this HRS documentation record). 
There are three types of contaminants generally found at wood treater facilities, either alone or in 
combination: creosote, PCP, and chromated copper arsenate (CCA). Creosote is an oily liquid made up of 
approximately 85% PAHs (Ref. 11, p. 23; Ref. 19, p. 165). In the wood preserving industry, creosote 
signifies a d istillate of coal tar produced by the high temperature carbonization of bituminous coal. Coal 
tar creosote refers to “the fractions or blends of fractions specifically used for timber preservation” (Ref. 
19, p. 165). The PAHs commonly found at wood treater sites include anthracene, benzo(a)anthracene, 
benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, fluoranthene, indeno(1,2,3 -cd)pyrene, PCP, 
phenanthrene, and pyrene (Ref. 11, p. 23; Ref. 19, pp. 166, 169 -171, 184). PCP was first used in the U.S. 
in 1936 as a wood preservative to prevent fungal decay and insect damage. PCP and by -products of its

     synthesis (hereinafter collectively referred to as PCP because those exposed to PCP are also exposed to 
products formed during its synthesis) include higher -chlorinated dioxins and furans (Ref. 20, pp. 1, 3). 
Common PCP synthesis by -products include polych lorinated phenols (tetra -and tri -); hexachlorobenzene 
(HCB); hexa -, hepta -, and octachlorodibenzo -p-dioxins (HxCDD, HpCDD, and OCDD); and hexa -, 
hepta -, and octachlorodibenzofurans. 2,3,7,8 -TCDD is a by -product of 2,4,5 -trichlorophenol; 2,3,7,8 -
TCDD may a lso result from the alkaline hydrolysis of HCB to PCP although it is rarely detected in 
commercial preparations (Ref. 20, pp. 1, 3). Metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, and 
lead, are associated with CCA or are otherwise commonly found at wo od treater sites (Ref. 11, p. 23). 
Pesticides may also be used in wood treatment to prevent rotting, insect damage, and mold (Ref. 23, p. 1). 
The presence of the PAH benzo(g,h,i)perylene and the phthalate bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (aka di(2 -
ethylhexyl) p hthalate) at the site may be associated with the use of pesticides during the wood treating 
process (Ref. 43, p. 2; Ref. 47, p. 1).

Facility Emissions to the Residential Neighborhood North of the J. H. Baxter Property 
Seasonal downwind direction from the facility is northward toward the residential neighborhood at AOC 
B (Ref. 21; Ref. 39, p. 33; Ref. 59, pp. 3, 14, 16, 35; Ref. 64; Ref. 92, p. 1). Since 1977, when the first air 
quality complaint was recorded, residents of the neighborhoods to the north and northeast of the facility 
have reported numerous complaints to LRAPA concerning odor and symptoms of illness (Ref. 59, p. 14; 
Ref. 88, pp. 5, 7, 8, 10; Ref. 90, pp. 11 -12). The number of air quality complaints peaked i n 2004, with 
762 complaints recorded (Ref. 88, p. 7; Ref. 90, pp. 11 -12). Soil deposition m odeling was performed to 
help determine which residential properties were likely to need removals of dioxin -contaminated soils just 
north of the J. H. Baxter facility (Ref. 92, p . 5). 
An Air Contaminant Discharge Permit renewal application submitted to LRAPA by Baxter in October 
2003 indicated that most of Baxter’s VOC emissions were from creosote. The permit application details 
the weight fraction of polycyclic aromatic compounds in ga seous emissions from liquid creosote, 
including naphthalene (44%), 2 -methylnaphthalene (13%), dibenzofuran (5%), acenaphthene (5%), 1 -
methylnaphthalene (4%), fluorene (2%), and phenanthrene (1%) (Ref. 59, p. 9). 
In 2005 -2006, LRAPA conducted an air sampling study in response to community concerns regarding 
emissions from J. H. Baxter. The study was designed to measure maximum downwind exposures in the 
neighborhoods nearest to the J. H. Baxter facility adjacent to the north, northeast and northwest. The 
process at the J. H. Baxter facility that generated the majority of the emissions used mixtures of creosote, 
oil and PCP to treat wood products for preservation. The various stages of treatment operations were 
perfor med in drying kilns and large retorts using pressure and vacuum. Emissions occurred from many 
points, including vacuum pumps, tank vents, retort door openings, and treated product storage (Ref. 59, 
p. 3).
Detections of hazardous substances related to plant site processes correlated well with downwind 
exposure. None of the facility -related hazardous substances were ever detected in samples that had no 
downwind exposure (Ref. 59, pp. 6, 9). LRAPA staff docume nted operations -related odors on the facility 
and in the neighborhood to the north during many of the air sampling events as part of the 2005 -2006 
study. Resident complaints were received during these times and confirmed by LRAPA staff (Ref. 59, pp. 
25-27, 29-34).
Other Facilities 
To assess attribution from the J. H. Baxter facility, multiple tools were used to examine other facilities 
within the area. A search of available environmental records was conducted by Environmental Data 
Resources, Inc. (EDR), including environmental databases, historical Sanborn maps, his torical 
topographic maps, historical aerial photographs, and historical city directories (Ref. 94, p. 1; Ref. 95, p.

   1; Ref. 96, p. 1; Ref. 97, p. 1; Ref. 98, p. 1; Ref. 99, p. 1). LRAPA provided information to EPA regarding 
other potential contributors of emissions in the facility area (Ref. 100). Public records databases were 
reviewed to identify other facilities within a mile radius of the J. H. Baxter facility that have CERCLA 
hazardous substances associated with them (Ref. 98 , p. 3 ; Ref. 100 , p. 1 ). 
The recycling facility, directly neighboring J. H. Baxter to the east, reports some dioxins and metals 
attributed to their emissions. This facility is situated on land owned by J. H. Baxter until 2007 and has 
been in business since 2015. (Ref. 100, p. 1). There are multiple other facilities within 1.5 miles of the J. 
H.Baxter site ( Ref. 93, pp. 1 -7). These facilities include lumber and sawmills , plywood, truss, cabinet and
veneer manufactures, recycling facilities , a landfill, auto sales, tire re -treaders, gas stations and garages, a
laboratory, chemical products wholesaler, electroplating, surface coating, paint, resin, and glue
manufactures, a printing facility, and sheet metal manufacturing (Ref. 94 ; Ref. 95; Ref. 96; Ref. 97; Ref.
98; Ref. 99; Ref. 100; Ref. 101; Ref. 102; Ref. 103; Ref. 104; Ref. 105; Ref. 106; Ref. 107; Ref. 108; Ref.
109; Ref. 110; Ref. 111; Ref. 112; see Ref. 93, pp. 1 -7 for specific page numbers). Some of these facilities
are associated with some of the same hazardous substances as those attributable to J. H. Baxter emissions
and wastes and thus could be contributing to the soil contamination in the larger site area. Most of these
facilities, however, are located to the south of the J. H. Baxter site, beyond background soil sample
locations (Figure 4 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 93, p. 1).
J. H. Baxter Attribution Summary 
For over 50 years, J. H. Baxter operated a wood treatment facility at its Roosevelt Boulevard location , 
formerly Baxter Street, in southwest Eugene, Lane County, Oregon (Figure 1 and Figure 2 of this HRS 
documentation record; Ref. 4, p. 13; Ref. 7, p. 18; Ref. 18, p. 6 ). The hazardous substances found in AOC 
A, located on the J. H. Baxter facility property, and /or AOC B, located immediately north and downwind 
of the J. H. Baxter facility and its emissions sources, are commonly associated with wood -treating 
operations and include PAHs, PCP, dioxins, furans, metals, and pesticides (see Tables 2 through 16 of this 
HRS documentation record ; Ref. 11, p. 23; Ref. 19, pp. 165, 166, 169 -171, 184; Ref. 20, pp. 1, 3; Ref. 23, 
p.1; Ref. 36, p. 1; Ref. 37, p. 2; Ref. 38, p. 1; Ref. 43, p. 2; Ref. 47, p. 1; Ref. 92, pp. 1, 5, 12 -35).
For decades, residents living in the neighborhoods to the north and northeast of the J. H. Baxter facility 
have reported complaints to LRAPA concerning odor and symptoms of illness (Ref. 59, p. 14; Ref. 88, 
pp. 5, 7, 8, 10; Ref. 90, pp. 11 -12). An Air Contaminant Discharge Permit renewal application submitted 
by J. H. Baxter in October 2003 indicated that most of J. H. Baxter’s VOC emissions were from creosote 
(Ref. 59, p. 9). In 2005 -2006, an air sampling study was conducted in response to community concer ns 
regarding emissions from J. H. Baxter. Detections of hazardous substances related to plant site processes 
correlated well with downwind exposure (Ref. 59, pp. 3, 6, 9). 
The J. H. Baxter site is located in an industrialized area. Other facilities have been identified in the site 
vicinity that may also be associated with some of the hazardous substances found in J. H. Baxter process 
and waste samples and that are present at observed contamination l evels in AOCs A and B ( Ref. 93, p. 1 -
7); some of these other facilities may have contributed to the soil contamination in the area. However, soil 
deposition m odeling indicates dioxin s and metals were likely to be deposited in the neighborhood north 
of the J. H. Baxter facility from J. H. Baxter’s emissions sources (Ref. 92, pp . 1, 5, 12 -35). Based on 
available evidence, including the soil deposition modeling , air emission data, the significantly lower 
contaminant levels found at background soil sample locations between the J. H. Baxter site and other 
facilities south of the site , downwind odor complaints directly tied to J. H. Baxter operations, samples of

  J. H. Baxter process products with high concentrations of generally the same hazardous substances as 
those found in the observed contamination , and predomina nt wind directions that are seasonally to the 
north , the hazardous substances found at levels significantly above background in AOC A and AOC B are 
clearly attributable , at least in part, to J. H. Baxter facility operations (Ref. 21; Ref. 39, pp. 33 , 56, 59; 
Ref. 59, pp. 3, 14, 16, 35; Ref. 64; Ref. 92, p. 1 ; Table 17 of this HRS documentation record).

Sa
mples documenting observed contamination  to residential properties north of the J. H. Baxter facility 
we
re collected during the 2021 ODEQ sampling event and the 2022 and 2023 EPA IA sampling events 
(Ref 4, pp. 15, 17-20). Residential samples were collected within property boundaries and within 200 feet 
of the residential  structures  within  AOC  B (Figure  3B of this  HRS documentation  record ). In addition, 
although operations ceased at the J. H. Baxter facility in 2022, two full-time workers continue to report to 
the facility to maintain the stormwater and groundwater treatment systems in the vicinity of AOC A and 
a single retort (Figure 2 and Figure 3A of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 4, p. 66).

  5.1.1.3.1 Resident Individual 
AOC Letter : B 
Level of Contamination : Level I 
According to the HRS, hazardous constituents that meet the criteria for an observed release (or observed 
contamination) and meet or exceed media -specific benchmark values meet the criteria for Level I 
contamination (Ref. 1, Sect. 2.5). Based on results from the 2021 ODEQ Soil Sampling Investigation and 
the 2023 Weston IA, Level I concentrations shown in Table 20 of this HRS documentation record have 
been established on residential properties (refer to HRS documentation record Section 5. 1.0, Summary of 
Site Contamination). A value of 50 is assigned to resident individual because there is at least one resident 
individual subject to Level I concentrations (Ref. 1, Sect. 5.1.1.3.1 ). 
Resident Individual Factor Value:  50

Observed contamination has been documented at residences in AOC B (see Section 5. 1.0). Interviews 
were conducted at most residences to determine the number of occupants in each household (Ref. 55). For 
residences where interviews were not conducted, each residence is multiplied by the U.S. Census persons 
per household for Lane County , Washington, to determine the resident population (Ref. 83).

NATIONAL  PRIORITIES  LIST  (NPL)  
***NPL  Site***  December 2024  
UPPER COLUMBIA RIVER   Washington   
 Upper Columbia River  
 Site Location:  
The Upper Columbia River site encompasses portions of the  Upper Columbia River that have  been impacted by  
hazardous substance contamination within Washington State and the areal extent of hazardous substances contamination  
within Washington State in or adjacent to the Upper Columbia River.  
 
 Site History:  
Historical disposal and discharges of  wastes  and emissions from  smelter operations have  contaminated portions of the  
site. Decades  of  releases  of  hazardous  substances  from  smelter  processes,  facility  operations  and  accidental  spills  to  the  
river  have  caused discharges of granulated slag, liquid effluents and other releases. The primary facility known to have  
contributed to hazardous substance contamination to the Upper Columbia River site is the Teck Metals Ltd. (Teck)  
facility located in Trail,  British Columbia, Canada on the Columbia River  approximately 10 river miles upstream of the  
international boundary. The former Le Roi smelter  located in Northport, Washington also contributed, to a lesser extent, 
hazardous substance contamination.  
 
 Site Contamination/Contaminants:  
Upland soils are contaminated with lead, arsenic, zinc, cadmium and other metals. Sediments in the river are  
contaminated with slag and metals, including lead, zinc, cadmium, copper, and mercury. There is a significant quantity 
of slag remaining in the river system. Surface  water sampling was conducted to assess concentrations of metals during  
various river conditions, locations, and depths. All samples were below human health drinking water and ecological  
surface water screening levels.  
 
 Potential Impacts  on Surrounding Community/Environment :  
Smelter stack emissions have resulted in elevated lead and arsenic concentrations affecting approximately 120 -square 
miles of uplands properties, including residential properties and  tribal allotments. Lead  and arsenic pose a human health  
risk to current and future residents through direct contact and incidental ingestion of soil, including from yards, gardens,  
and/or play areas. Metals including zinc, cadmium and lead in upland soils  pose a potential  risk to soil invertebrates,  
small birds, and mammals. River sediments are  contaminated with slag  and metals, including lead, zinc, cadmium,  
copper, and mercury in exceedance of ecological  screening levels.  
 
 Response Activities (to  date):  
In 2004, the EPA performed soil cleanup work at Le Roi smelter property and several nearby residential properties. 
From  2015 to 2018, Teck American Inc., under EPA oversight, conducted soil cleanup at 18 residential properties  and 
a tribal  allotment. In 2020 and  2022,  the  EPA  conducted  additional  soil  cleanup  actions  at  residential  properties.  As  of  
2024,  the  EPA  has  performed  soil cleanup at 62 residential properties and 6 common use areas.  
 
 Need for NPL Listing:  
NPL listing is needed to ensure completion of  cleanup of both upland a nd aquatic portions of the site, including making 
federal funds available, if needed. Letters of support for placing this site on the NPL  were  received from the state, the  
Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, and the Spokane Tribe of India  
   
   [The description of the site (relea se) is based on info rmation available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS . The description  may change as additional information is gath ered on the sources and extent of contamin ation. See 56 FR 5600, Februa ry 11, 1991, or  subsequent FR notices.]

iii Executive Summary  
Section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the EPA prepare a list of national 
priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants 
throughout the United States. An original National Priorities List (NPL) was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). CERCLA requires that EPA update the list at least annually. 
T
his document provides responses to public comments received on the Upper Columbia River site, proposed on 
March 7, 2024 (89 FR 16498). This site is being added to the NPL based on an evaluation under EPA’s Hazard Ranking System (HRS) in a final rule published in the Federal Register in December 2024. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 iv  Introduction 
This document explains the rationale for adding the Upper Columbia River site in Upper Columbia River, 
Washington to the National Priorities List (NPL) of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites and provides responses to 
public comments received on this site li sting proposal. The EPA proposed this site to the NPL on March 7, 2024 
(89 FR 16498). This site is being added to the NPL based on an evaluation under the Hazard Ranking System 
(HRS) in a final rule published in the Federal Register in December 2024. 
 
Background of the NPL 
In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. Sections 9601 et seq . in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. 
CERCLA was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), 
Public Law No. 99-499, stat., 1613 et seq. To implement CERCLA, EPA promulgated the revised National Oil 
and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA Section 105 and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP, further 
revised by EPA on September 16, 1985 (50 FR 37624) and November 20, 1985 (50 FR 47912), sets forth 
guidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. On March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666), EPA further revised the NCP in 
response to SARA.  
 Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the NCP include:  
 
criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United 
States for the purpose of taking remedial action and, to the extent practicable, taking into account 
the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action. 
 Removal action involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response to emergency conditions or on a 
short-term or temporary basis (CERCLA Section 101). Remedial action is generally long- term in nature and 
involves response actions that are consiste nt with a permanent remedy for a release (CERCLA Section 101). 
Criteria for placing sites on the NPL, which makes them eligible for remedial actions financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA, were included in the HRS. EPA promulgated the HRS as Appendix A of the NCP 
(47 FR 31219, July 16, 1982). On December 14, 1990 (56 FR 51532), EPA promulgated revisions to the HRS in 
response to SARA, and established the effective date for the HRS revisions as March 15, 1991. On January 9, 
2017, EPA promulgated a further revision to the HRS that added a component for evaluating the threats posed by the intrusion of subsurface contamination into regularly occupied structures. These changes are consistent with, 
and comply with, the statutory requirements of SARA.  
 
Section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended, requires that the statutory criteria provided by the HRS be used to 
prepare a list of national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throu ghout the United States. The list, which is Appendix B of the NCP, is the NPL. 
 An original NPL of 406 sites was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). At that time, an HRS score 
of 28.5 was established as the cutoff for listing because it yielded an initial NPL of at least 400 sites, as suggested 
by CERCLA. The NPL has been expanded several times since then, most recently on September 5, 2024 (89 FR 72331). The Agency also has published a number of proposed rulemakings to add sites to the NPL. The most 
recent proposal was on September 5, 2024 (89 FR 72356). 
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 v  Development of the NPL 
The primary purpose of the NPL is stated in the legislative history of CERCLA (Report of the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works, Senate Report No. 96-848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 [1980]).  
The priority list serves primarily informational purposes, identifying for the States and the public those facilities and sites or other releases which appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a 
facility or site on the list does not in itself refle ct a judgment of the activities of its owner or 
operator, it does not require those persons to undertake any action, nor does it assign liability to 
any person. Subsequent government actions will be necessary in order to do so, and these actions 
will be attended by all appropriate procedural safeguards. 
 The NPL, therefore, is primarily an informational and management tool. The identification of a site for the NPL is 
intended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of the human health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA -
financed remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of sites EPA believes warrant further investigation. Finally, listing a site may , to the extent potentially responsible parties are 
identifiable at the time of listing, serve as notice to such parties that the Agency may initiate CERCLA -financed 
remedial action.  
 CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites among the known releases or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, and Section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certain 
enumerated and other appropriate factors in doing so. Thus, as a matter of policy, EPA has the discretion not to 
use CERCLA to respond to certain types of releases. Where other authorities exist, placing sites on the NPL for 
possible remedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Ther efore, EPA has chosen not to place certain 
types of sites on the NPL even though CERCLA does not exclude such action. If, however, the Agency later 
determines that sites not listed as a matter of policy are not being properly responded to, the Agency may consider 
placing them on the NPL. 
 
Hazard Ranking System 
The HRS is the principal mechanism EPA uses to place uncontrolled waste sites on the NPL. It is a numerically 
based screening system that uses information from initial, limited investigations -- the preliminary assessment and 
site inspection -- to assess t he relative potential of sites to pose a threat to human health or the environment. HRS 
scores, however, do not determine the sequence in which EPA funds remedial response actions, because the information collected to develop HRS scores is not sufficient i n itself to determine either the extent of 
contamination or the appropriate response for a particular site. Moreover, the sites with the highest scores do not necessarily come to the Agency's attention first, so that addressing sites strictly on the basis of ranking would in 
some cases require stopping work at sites where it was already underway. Thus, EPA relies on further, more detailed studies in the remedial investigation/feasibility study that typically follows listing.  
 The HRS uses a structured value analysis approach to scoring sites. This approach assigns numerical values to 
factors that relate to or indicate risk, based on conditions at the site. The factors are grouped into three categories. 
Each category has a maxim um value. The categories are:  
 
• likelihood that a site has released or has the potential to release hazardous substances into the 
environment; Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
vi •characteristics of the waste (e.g., toxicity and waste quantity); and
•targets (e.g., people or sensitive environments) affected by the release.
Unde
r the HRS, four pathways can be scored for one or more components and threats as identified below: 
•Gr
ound Water Migration (S gw)
— population
•Su
rface Water Migration (S sw)
The following threats are evaluated for two separate migration components, overland/flood migration and
ground water to surface water.
— drinking water
— human food chain
— sensitive environments
•Soi
l Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion (S sessi)
— Soil Exposure Component:
o resident population
o nearby population
— Subsurface Intrusion Component
opopulation
•Ai
r Migration (S a)
— population
Af
ter scores are calculated for one or more pathways according to prescribed guidelines, they are combined using 
the following root -mean -square equation to determine the overall site score (S), which ranges from 0 to 100 : 
If all pathway scores are low, the HRS score is low. However, the HRS score can be relatively high even if only 
one pathway score is high. This is an important requirement for HRS scoring because some extremely 
dangerous sites pose threats through only one pathway. For example, buried leaking drums of hazardous 
substances can c ontaminate drinking water wells, but - - if the drums are buried deep enough and the substances 
not very volatile -- not surface water or air. 
Other Mechanisms for Listing 
There are two mechanisms other than the HRS by which sites can be p laced  on the NPL. The first of these 
mechanisms, authorized by the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), allows each State and Territory to designate one 
site as its high est priority regardless of score. The last mechanism,  authorized by the NCP at 40  CFR 
300.425(c)(3), allows listing a site if it meets the following three requirements: 
•Ag
ency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued
a health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release;
•EPA determines the site poses a significant threat to public health; andUpper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 vii  • EPA anticipates it will be more cost- effective to use its remedial authority than to use its emergency removal 
authority to respond to the site.

2. Site Description 
The Upper Columbia River site (the Site) includes the release of metals from two smelters (Cominco1 and Le Roi 
smelters) to the Upper Columbia River and to soil . Associated contamination in the area is the combined result of 
historical discharges of wastes and emissions from the two smelter operations, some of which has comingled in 
soils and surface water sediments. Upland soils in the area are contaminated with  metals, including arsenic and 
lead. Sediments in the Upper Columbia River contain slag, a by- product of smelting, and are contaminated with

 5  metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc. There is a significant 
quantity of slag present in the river system. The Site is being placed on the NPL based on an HRS evaluation of 
the Site documenting that contamination in sediments and soil achieve an NPL-eligible HRS site score. Although 
the contamination has comingled, the HRS documentation record at proposal also showed that releases associated with the Cominco smelter (approximately 10 miles upstream of the i nternational border) and releases associated 
with the Le Roi smelter (approximately 10 river miles downstream of the international border) each would independently achieve an NPL qualifying HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately. 
 
The HRS evaluation of the Site scored the surface water migration pathway based on concentrations of hazardous substances in sediment s from the Upper Columbia River and the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway 
based on the concentrations of hazardous substances in soil . As presented in the HRS documentation record at 
proposal, the Site, for HRS scoring purposes, includes contaminated sediments in the Upper Columbia River 
between and downstream of the three scored HRS sources spanning approximately 35 river miles of the Columbia 
River  from the U.S.-Canada border south and west to Marcus, Washington (see Figure 1 of this support document 
below). The Site includes three scored sources: slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter, 
which is currently owned by Teck Metals Ltd.  and located upstream of the international border in Canada (Source 
1); contaminated soil on the  former Le Roi smelter facility in Northport, Washington (Source 2); and sluice box 
discharge associated with the former Le Roi smelter (Source 3). These sources have been documented to contain metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver, zinc, and mercury. The 
releases from the smelters have become comingled in the Upper Columbia River (at and downstream of the Le 
Roi smelter) . In addition, an area of observed contamination (AOC) in soil in Northport, Washington was 
documented in the HRS documentation record at proposal. R eleases from both facilities have also  become 
comingled in the AOC soil contamination.  
In the evaluation of the surface water migration pathway, contamination and targets were scored in the HRS 
documentation record at proposal for the U.S. portion of the zone of contamination, which encompasses a length of approximately 35 river miles. Both an observed release by direct observation and an observed release by 
chemical analysis were documented. Observed releases by direct observation were scored based on Cominco smelter discharge of hazardous substance-bearing slag/effluent to the river and Le Roi smelter discharge of 
hazardous substance -bearing slag to the river. An observed release by chemical analysis based on the 
concentrations of metals (i.e., antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc) in sediment s was established in the HRS documentation record at proposal. Targets in the surface water migration 
pathway (i.e., fishery, wetlands, and a federal- designated threatened species habitat) were evaluated as subject to 
Level II concentrations. 
 
In the evaluation of the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, t he AOC 
is located in a residential area to the southwest of the former Le Roi smelter and is defined by a polygon bounded 
by soil contamination meeting HRS observed contamination criteria (i.e., locations showing lead and arsenic at 
concentrations significantly above published background levels and collected from the top 2 feet of soil). This 
AOC is attributable to historical aerial deposition from both smelters. Historical smelter smokestack emissions 
from both smelters have resulted in upland residential soil contamination; residential populations subject to Level 
I and Level II contamination for HRS scoring purposes  associated with the AOC were documented in the HRS 
documentation record at proposal for the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion 
pathway.  
 
Since 2003, numerous EPA removal activities have occurred in and around the Northport, Washington area, inc
luding several removal site evaluations (RSEs). In 2003 and 2004, Northport residential and commercial 
properties with lead concentrations in soil greater than the removal action level  of 1,000 milligrams per kilogram 
(mg/kg ) were identified for a time-critical removal action (TCRA). In 2004, a removal action was conducted at 
the former Le Roi smelter and residential areas with the excavated contaminat ed soils being consolidated at an 11-
acre area of the Le Roi smelter site. In 2014 and 2016, residential properties and tribal allotments were sampled. 
For these sampling events, a removal action level of 700 mg/kg for lead in soil was evaluated.  In an EPA dispute Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 6  decision issued in 2015, EPA stated an intent to select a lower removal action level for lead in soil, lowering the 
action level from 1,000 mg/kg to 700 mg/kg. Based on analytical results from residential soil sampling, TCRAs 
were conducted in 2015, 2017, and 2018 using a removal action level of 700 mg/kg. The EPA conducted 
additional RSE s at properties within the town of Northport that were sampled in 2003 and 2004 as described 
above and found to have lead in soil at concentrations near or above 700 mg/kg. In 2020, soil cleanup activities 
were conducted  using a removal action level of 700 mg/kg. The EPA conducted a subsequent RSE in the 
residential area of Northport in 2021. TCRAs were conducted at additional properties in 2022 using a removal action level for lead in soil of 700 mg/kg. In 2024, additional TCRAs were conducted using a removal action level 
of 200 mg/kg.  
 
Addi
tional investigations have been ongoing at the Site, including a remedial investigation and feasibility study 
(RI/FS). The RI/FS is underway as part of the 2006 Settlement Agreement between Teck Cominco Metals Ltd., Teck Cominco American Incorporated (TAI), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and the EPA; there is no
 
settlement agreement for funding or performance of a potential remedial action . In February 2021, the EPA 
released a Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) for the Upper Columbia River site, which was conducted as 
part of the ongoing RI/FS. An Upland Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment and an Aquatic Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment are also underway. The ongoing RI/FS will guide subsequent stages of the CERCLA process, 
and information from completed, ongoing, and subsequent investigations will inform the ultimate extent of s ite-
related contamination. Completed site investigations and remedial work, as well as time critical removal actions,  
were considered  in the HRS evaluation of the Site, and the current conditions in sediments and soil at the Site 
achieve an HRS site score, describ ed above, that is eligible for placement on the NPL as presented in the HRS 
documentation record at proposal.

 8  3. Summary of Comments  
The state of Washington, the Spokane Tribe of Indians , the Confederated Tribes of the Co lville Reservation2 the 
Lands Council, the Upper Columbia United Tribes , the Spokane Mountaineers, and 20 citizens supported or did 
not oppose placing the Site on the NPL.  
 
Teck American Incorporated3 (TAI) , the Stevens County Board of County Commissioners4 (hereinafter referred 
to as Stevens County), the Eastern Washington Council of Governments (EWCOG), the Lincoln County 
Commissioners (Lincoln County), South Columbia Basin Irrigation District (SCBID), East Columbia Basin Irrigation District (ECBID) , Quincy- Columbia Basin Irrigation District (QCBID) , Board of Commissioners, 
County of Benton ( Benton County ), the Rimrock Cabin Owners Association, and 47 citizens opposed placing the 
Site on the NPL. TAI also requested that the EPA consider its comments prior to adding the Site on the NPL.  
 TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens provided comments on the supporting data and documentation. TAI 
and Stevens County questioned the data included in the HRS documentation record at proposal, asserting that 
additional data and information were available as a part of the ongoing RI/FS. TAI stated that “arbitrarily limited 
data and completed studies” were used. TAI commented that evaluating the Site with the HRS is inappropriate 
given the level of investigation into the Site already completed.  
 
In discussing the Site as presented at proposal, TAI and Stevens County commented  on perceived difference s 
between the site as described in previous EPA communication and the Site as scored. TAI and Stevens County asserted that past descriptions of the Site pointed to uplands residential soil contamination , while the HRS 
documentation record at proposal primarily focuses on the sediment contamination in the Upper Columbia River.   
TAI questioned the inclusion of the Northport area as part of the Site asserting  that the Northport area has 
historically been treated as a separate site from the Upper Columbia River. TAI disagreed with comingling of the 
smelters’ contamination in soil as the basis for inclusion of the Northport area as part of the site, asserting that 
Cominco smelter aerial emissions are limited to the smelter in British Columbia and a few miles into Washington .  
 Several commenters submitted comments discussing possible effects of the NPL designation. TAI, Stevens County, and multiple citizens expressed concern for how liability will be assigned for the contamination and/or 
what the sources of funding for remediati on of the contamination will be. Stevens County, Lincoln County, 
SCBID, QCBID , ECBID  and 20 citizens provided comments discussing the possible impacts to the region, 
including negative economic impacts, as a result of a NPL designation.  
 Several commenters opposed to listing provided comments discussing issues related to the listing process. 
Comments related to the listing process include:  
 
• Comments questioning the rationale for listing given that the Site is undergoing an RI/FS.  
• Comments asserting that the HRS is intended for a limited evaluation of a Site in the preliminary stages of the evaluation process.  
• Assertions that there is no need for listing based on the conditions at the Site.  
 
2 See the December 6, 2023 , letter from the Confederated Tribes of the Col ville Reservation  to EPA, included as Attachment 
A of this support document . 
3 Teck American Incorporated  submitted comments on the proposed listing and is an affiliate of Teck Metals Ltd. , the owner 
and operator of the Trail smelter  (also referred to as the Cominco Smelter and the Teck Cominco Smelter)  in Canada .  
4 The Stevens County Board of County Commissioners submitted comments on its behalf along with comments on behalf of 
the Eastern Washington Council of Governments. (See Docket ID EPA -HQ-OLEM -2024- 0068 -0080 on regulations.gov  fo r 
the combined comment submission by Stevens County and the Eastern Washington Council of Governments.) Comments 
specifically authored by the Eastern Washington Council of Governments were included as Attachment E of the combined comment submission.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 9  • Assertions that information about the Site has been delayed or withheld.  
• Requests that listing not occur until after the completion of the RI/FS for the Site.  
• Comments that ecological benefits are overdue and ineffective.  
 
Additionally, in Attachments A5 and D6 to its comment submission, in opposition of NPL listing and 
disagreement with the state concurrence with listing,  Stevens County stated that they “do not relinquish” their 
“authority as elected officials over to the governor.”  
 
Multiple commenters discussed whether the risk posed by the Site is sufficient for NPL placement, commenting  
that: 
 
• The Site does not pose a risk to human health.  
• Fish from the Upper Columbia River are generally not impacted .  
• Soil contamination at residential properties is being or has been addressed via removal actions or remedial 
activities .  
• The quality of water in the Columbia River is clean and/or meets water quality standards.  
• The area is clean except for rubbish.  
 In questioning technical aspects of the HRS scoring of the Site, TAI commented that slag is not a hazardous 
substance under CERCLA , and that the solid waste definition in 40 CFR 261.4 excludes slag. TAI asserted that 
since slag is not a hazardous substance under CER CLA, using slag to determine the hazardous waste quantity for 
Source 1 is incorrect and misleading.  
 In challenging the evaluation of the surface water migration pathway, commenters asserted that : 
 
• The slag in the river is unlikely to release metals.   
• Contamination is buried in sediment at deeper depths , and it would be safer to leave it as-is than risking 
rereleasing the associated metals by stirring sediments during removal processes .  
• The other possible sources not scored section of the HRS documentation record at proposal is incomplete  
because it does not discuss other possible origins of contamination .  
• The waste characteristics factor category value was inappropriately calculated and overestimated . 
• Fish from the Columbia River are generally safe for consumption.  
• The Site may not be the driver of fish advisories in place for sensitive groups .  
 In commenting on the evaluation of the soil exposure component, commenters asserted  that: 
 
• The soil exposure component would no t achieve an NPL -eligible score by itself .  
• The extent of residential contamination described in general EPA communications is an overstatement of 
the residential land use area.  
• Areas identified as residential for scoring purposes or future cleanup purposes inappropriately included 
forest, industrial, and commercial areas.  
• Only limited soil contamination remains because properties above the action level have been remediated.  
 
In this support document, the EPA responds to comments submitted on the March 2024 proposed listing of the 
Upper Columbia River  site. After consideration of these items, the HRS site score remains unchanged , and the 
EPA is appropriately placing the site on the NPL.

10 3.1 Support for Listing and Other Non-opposition Comments 
The state of Washington, the Spokane Tribe of Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the Co lville Reserv ation,7 the 
Lands Council, the Upper Columbia United Tribes, the Spokane Mountaineers and 20 citizens expressed support 
for the proposed listing of the Site on the NPL.  
T
he state of the Washington expressed willingness to participate with cleanup activities  at the Site. Reasons for 
support provided by the state of Washington include: 
•Addr
essing historical contamination that may be posing risks to human health and the environment ,
p
articularly to low -income and Tribal resident s
•O
btain ing funding for a comprehensive cleanu p
•Allo
wing for additional and timely cleanup and investigation as the current RI/FS work is bei ng
co
mpleted under a settlement agreement
•Allowing for cleanup which is outside of the scope of the RI/FS settlement agreement
•Allowing for authority over the Site investigation and cleanup in accordance with CERCLA
•Enabling cost recover y
The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation  provided support for the EPA’s proposal to add the Site on 
the NPL, noting t hey will coordinate with EPA staff as the NPL listing process moves forward. T hey commented  
that NPL listing will bring access to resources needed for cleanup of the Site.  
The Spokane Tribe of Indians expresse d support for NPL lis ting, referring  to the negative impacts associated w ith 
Site-related c ontamination , such as health and  welfare impacts, economi c security,  and political integrity of the 
Spokane Tribe of Indians. The Spokane Tribe of Indians asserted that delays have occurred as a resu lt of the Site 
not being placed on the NPL and the RI/FS process is still ongoing. O ther reason s for support cited by the 
Spokane Tribe of Indians include the ability of the EPA to use federal funding, control of cleanup , cost recovery, 
the ability o f the EPA to  better c haracterize the  contamination.   
The Spokane Tribe of Indians concurred wit h the propose d listing of the Site on the NPL assumi ng that the Site is 
“meant to encompass the Upper Columbia River from the U.S. Canadia n border and downstream , including Lake 
Roosevelt, to the Grand Coulee Dam.” The Spokane Tribe of Indians commente d that the HRS documentation 
record at proposal provided an incomplete characterizati on of the contamination i n that it focuse d on the area 
from the border to Marcus , Washington, and requeste d that future remedial inve stigations and  response activities 
characteri ze the  lower r iver.  
The Upper Columbia United Tribes supported the proposal to add the Site to the NPL, stating that NPL placement 
would allow for fundi ng, legal status , and resources t o address contamination affecting the land, water, and 
wildlife. T he U pper C olumbia U nited Tribes asserted t hat site-related co ntaminants, suc h as metals, may be 
posing a risk to human health a nd the environment. T hey stated that the “ federal government should dedicate 
more resources to address t he legacy of  heavy  metal p ollution  in the waters and lands of the uppe r Columbia 
Region.” They als o stated that the government should procee d “in recovering clea n and s afe environments in 
support of these recovery efforts and the communities who stand to benefit from them.” 
Multiple citizens and the Spokane Mountaineers support ed listing. O ne citizen provided support for listing i f 
access to the Upper Columbia River or Lake Roosevelt is not restricted. A citizen commented that CERCLA 
activities have fallen short in addressing sites in the past. One citizen also asserted that negative economic impacts 
7 See the December 6, 2023 , letter from the Confederated Tribes of the Col ville Reservation  to EPA, included as Attachment 
A of this support document . Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 11  may not necessarily occur and property values may not necessarily decrease. Additional reasons for support 
provided by commenters include: 
 
• Cleanup of s ite-related contamination  
• Protection of human health, wildlife, and/or the environment  
• Possible negotiations and funding for cleanup  
• Positive impacts to the economy as a result of remediation of contamination  
• The possible removal of buried waste at the former Le Roi smelter property.  
 
The Lands Council and a citizen expressed a request for cooperation with tribes in addressing the Site.  
 
Response : The EPA has added the Upper Columbia River site to the NPL. Listing makes a site eligible for 
remedial action funding under CERCLA, and the EPA will examine the site to determine what response, if any, is 
appropriate. Actual funding may not necessarily be undertaken in the precise order of HRS scores, however, and upon more detailed investigation may not be necessary at all in some cases. The EPA will determine the need for 
using Superfund monies for remedial activities on a site-by- site basis, considering the NPL ranking, State 
priorities, further site investigation, other response alternatives, and other factors as appropriate.  
 
Regarding the Site definition and extent of S ite, please see sections 3.4, Site Description and Definition , and 3.5, 
Extent of Site, of this support document.  
  Regarding a commenter’s concern about access to the Upper Columbia River, the EPA acknowledges the 
commenter ’s concern and notes that access to the river is not determined by the listing decision.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.2 Community Involvement 
Comment : TAI , Stevens County, and six citizens submitted comments about EPA communications to the public, 
the level of community involvement, and the EPA’s coordination with local government.  
 
TAI stated that the EPA made incorrect statements in public communications about benefits the EPA may gain 
through NPL designation. TAI asserted that the EPA’s news release about the proposed listing of the Upper 
Columbia River site on the NPL “incorrectly suggests that a site listing automatically ensures EPA can access 
Superfund dollars: ‘Listing the site on the NPL allows EPA to access Superfund dollars for cleanup activities 
which can also help ensure a more timely cleanup.’”8 TAI commented NPL listing makes sites eligible for federal 
funding, and it  does not guarantee that funding. TAI also pointed to a local newspaper article in which an EPA 
spokesman stated that NPL listing gives the EPA “access to  legal tools that could compel action if needed.”9 
However, TAI argued that NPL listing “does not, in itself, reflect the responsible parties or the bases of their 
liability, require those entities to take any action, determine whether remediation is possible or even necessary or 
the extent of any potential remediation, or assign liability to any person or entity.” TAI also argued that NPL 
listing does not give the EPA additional enforcement authority.  
 
Stevens County and multiple citizens discussed the level of community involvement and coordination with local 
government. Stevens County commented that while the EPA has indicated that it would like to work with the 
community and local officials to ensure contaminated areas that have been identified are within acceptable levels, 
 
8 TAI cited a March 5, 2024 EPA news release available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -
columbia -river -wa-superfund- list. TAI quoted the statement, “L isting the site on the NPL allows EPA to access Superfund 
dollars for cleanup activities which can also help ensure a more timely cleanup. ” 
9 TAI cited a March 5, 2024 article in The Spokesman -Review available at 
https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/mar/05/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -to-superf/ .  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 12  it has been not included in the process. Five  citizens commented that local officials’ input has been ignored, and 
three of these citizens argued that local officials would be communicating there is a problem if concerning levels 
of contamination were present in the Upper Columbia River area. Five ci tizens also stated that the urgency to list 
the Site on the NPL is politically motivated.  
 
Stevens County stated that “ local elected officials do not concur with EPA that NPL listing is needed or warranted 
at this time .” Stevens County asserted that it is “willing to help” and “EPA regional staff should be focused on 
working with the local governments.” Stevens County commented that it is willing to cooperate to find solutions 
for health, safety, and ecological concerns. Two citizens commented that government officials opposed the designation, and one of these citizens suggested that local officials should be consulted about the issue.  
 
Stevens County asserted that EPA provided insufficient information and communication. It commented that:  
 
• The EPA has delayed and withheld information .  
• A local group received a draft document— the draft Upland Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment 
(BERA) —from the EPA for comment while the local government was not given the same opportunity.  
• The messaging provided by the EPA suggested soil contamination is the issue at the Site although the 
scoring of the Site relied on other data.  
• Data used in the listing, including compounds and metals other than lead, were not provided to the local government.  
• The EPA has not been transparent in the process, and misleading information about the process has been provided.  
• The EPA provided different information in public meetings than in the proposal to add the Site to the NPL.  
• The Governor provided a concurrence letter to the EPA without obtaining input from the local government.  
• Local public health offices were not consulted.  
 One citizen requested that, before allowing federal government and EPA involvement, local residents should be 
allowed to participate and given a controlling vote. Two  citizen s asserted that local individuals would be more 
familiar with the area. A citizen also commented that the local community should be given opportunities for input and discussion along with local voting options for agreed-upon cleanup.  
 
Response : The EPA communicated with  the public frequently during the site assessment and RI/FS stage s and has 
made multiple efforts to involve the community and other interested parties throughout the RI/FS  and site 
assessment stages. The EPA will continue community engagement efforts for the Site throughout the CERCLA 
process.   
 Regarding the procedures used to list the Site on the NPL, the EPA complied with all relevant administrative 
requirements. The HRS evaluation of the Site is consistent with the HRS regulation and the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA). The HRS documentation record at proposal and this support document clearly document 
that the EPA has complied with the HRS regulation; this support document addresses all comments on the 
proposed listing of this Site, including those comments that challenge compliance with the HRS, and shows that 
HRS requirements have been met in every aspect of the evaluation of this Site.  
 
As part of the standard community involvement process, the Superfund program offers numerous opportunities 
for public participation at NPL sites. The EPA Regional Office develop s a Community Involvement Plan (CIP) 
before  remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS)  field work begins . The CIP is the “work plan” for Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 13  community relations activities that the EPA will conduct during the entire cleanup process. In developing a CIP, 
Regional staff interview s State and local officials and interested citizens to learn about citizen concerns, site 
conditions, and local history. This information is used to formulate a schedule of activities designed to keep citizens apprised and to keep the EPA aware of community concerns. Typical community relations activities 
include: 
 
• Public meetings where  the EPA presents a summary of technical information regarding the site and 
citizens can ask questions or comment  
• Small, informal public sessions where  EPA representatives are available to citizens 
• Development and distribution of fact sheets to keep citizens up to date on site activities 
 
For each site , an “information repository” is established, usually in a librar y or town hall  and/or on an EPA Web 
site, containing reports, studies, fact sheets, and other documents containing information about the site. The  EPA 
Regional Office continually updates the repository and must ensure that the facility housing the repository has copying capabilities. For the Upper Columbia River site, t he EPA Regional Office developed a CIP for the Site in 
2004 before the start of the RI/FS, and information repositories have been established in libraries in the local communities . 
 
In addition to meeting federal requirements, the  EPA ensure s that community involvement is a continuing activity 
designed to meet the specific needs of the community. Anyone wanting information should contact the Community Involvement Coordinator in the appropriate EPA Regional Office.  
 To provide information about the ongoing progress at the Upper Columbia River site , because a remedial 
investigation/feasibility study is ongoing, the EPA maintains an Upper Columbia River Study Area webpage 
(https://www.epa.gov/columbiariver/upper- columbia -river -study- area). This webpage provides the community 
and other interested parties information regarding the Site status, publicly available documents, including fact sheets, and other relevant site- specific information. The EPA hosted numerous outreach events in the community 
regarding the Site . These outreach activities have included public meetings and briefings with members of 
Congress and local officials. Table 1 below presents a selected list of outreach events the EPA conducted prior to proposal.

Region 10 dating back to 200 0 regarding the Upper Columbia River site.  
 
Additionally, as part of the EPA’s Technical Assistance Services for Communities  program , the EPA awarded 
Citizens for a Clean Columbia a technical assistance contract to fund participation and a review of the RI/FS 
process. The EPA provides further information regarding community technical assistance on its Upper Columbia 
River Study A rea webpage.  
 
Regarding coordination with the public and other interested parties or stakeholders, t he CERCLA process 
encourages public participation , including potentially responsible parties. The public can comment during the 
comment period (typically 60 days) after a site is proposed for listing on the NPL and during the time the EPA is 
evaluating and selecting a remedy. The EPA may also hold a publ ic hearing during the latter decision -making 
period. If private parties conduct remedial actions under a consent decree between the EPA and the parties, the decree is also subject to public comment. The EPA believes that the above process offers the public sufficient opportunity to present facts and opinions germane to its decision-making.   
 Regarding comments addressing the tools that become accessible to the EPA as a result of  listing a site, the EPA 
statements referred to by TAI and communicated to the public regarding funding and legal tools are correct. In 
public communications the EPA stated that NPL listing allow s the EPA “to access Superfund dollars for cleanup 
activities .” This statement did not assert that such funding is automatic at listing  or that remedial action is 
automatic. Listing a site on the NPL also gives the EPA “access to legal tools that could compel action if needed.” This statement by the EPA about access to legal tools does not imply that the NPL listing itself assigns liability or 
requires specific remedial actions.  With NPL listing, EPA may use federal funds to advance CERCLA response 
actions when negotiations with a potentially responsible party or parties (PRPs) are not successful or become protracted, or if a PRP is not in compliance with an enforcement order or settlement agreement . The EPA would 
then seek to recover its costs from the PRP (s). This approach incentivizes PRPs to negotiate or to comple te work  
becau se the cost for a private party to conduct work is generally less expensive than costs incurred by the EPA . 
Both the EPA statement on potential funding from an NPL listing and enforcement tools that may be available 
from listing are consistent with the explanation of the limited significance of the NPL outlined in the Federal 
Register  notice proposing this Site to the NPL (89 FR 16498). 
 Regarding the information and data used to support the proposed addition of the Site to the NPL, please see 
section 3.3, Adequacy of Documentation, of this support document for a detailed discussion.  
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  
 
3.3 Adequacy of Documentation  
Comment: TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens asserted that insufficient data or documentation were 
available to support placing the Site on the NPL.  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 15  TAI and Stevens County commented that the Site has been extensively studied as part of the RI/FS and these data 
were not included in the HRS scoring of the Site. TAI commented that the HRS is not appropriate for the Site 
because of the extensive investigation already completed for the Site. Stevens County stated that the HRS scoring 
is incomplete. TAI stated that the HRS scoring “did not incorporate the bulk of the RI/FS data” and used “arbitrarily limited data and completed studies” despite the availabilit y of additional technical information that is 
sometimes more current and comprehensive. Stevens County also commented that prior data are available from the RI/FS process on the Upper Columbia River. TAI asserted that the most recent data from the RI/FS sh ould be 
used to reflect the current risk posed by the Site.   In discussing the data used, Stevens County stated that the HRS scoring used “other unscientific data to list the 
area on the NPL.” Stevens County commented that HRS scoring should be completed based on the known risk 
associated with the Site as opposed to “guesses.” Stevens County commented that data for compounds and metals 
other than lead used in the documentation to support the proposed listing were not provided to it.  
 
Stevens County and 10 citizens made additional assertions regarding the adequacy of the supporting 
documentation. Stevens County asserted that it is unclear why the Site achieved an NPL eligible HRS site score given that no human health risk is associated with the Site and no c onclusive data on sediment contamination 
from the Upper Columbia River are present. Four  citizens commented that the proposed designation lacks 
scientific evidence to support the decision. Four  citizens commented that placing the Site on the NPL prior to the 
completion of the RI/FS suggests that the decision is being made without important data. Three citizens commented that there is a lack of scientific data to support the NPL designation or scope of the Site because the RI/FS process  is still underway. Two citizens expressed opposition to the proposed NPL designation until 
ongoing studies have been completed and verified. As part of the assertion that available data were incomplete, three citizens stated that there are no blood test r esults for children living in the impacted area that would support 
listing the Site on the NPL.   Regarding availability of documentation and data, one citizen commented that the five documents for review did 
not include data tables or a map. This citizen also asserted that the fact sheet appears to indicate that remediation 
occurred at the areas with higher contamination and no associated data were provided.  
 
Response : 
 The data relied upon in the HRS documentation record at proposal are of sufficient quantity and type 
for the purposes of scoring the Site and Site placement on the NPL. Relevant data for the NPL listing were 
included in the HRS documentation record referen ces at proposal and are available to the public via the Site 
docket10. Documents referenced in the HRS documentation record at proposal were available to the public upon 
request via the Region 10 S ite docket at the time of proposal  as described in the Federal Register notice proposing 
the Site to the NPL . The docket for the Site at the time of proposal was also sufficient for the public to review the 
HRS evaluation of the Site. As shown in other sections of this support document, the scoring of the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway were 
supported in the HRS documentation record at proposal and achieved an HRS site score a bove the NPL listing 
threshold of 28.50.  
The EPA used appropriate levels of data and investigation in determining the HRS score for the Site consistent 
with HRS regulation. As explained in the preamble in the Federal Register notice promulgating the 1990 HRS (55 FR 51533, December 14, 1990), Congress, in discussing the substantive standards against which HRS 
revisions could be assessed, stated:  
 
10 The EPA maintains dockets for the Site at EPA Headquarters and Region 10, which are available to the public per the 
instructions provided in the Federal Register  notice proposing the Site to the NPL (89 FR 16498 March 7, 2024). The 
documents in the EPA Headquarters docket explain the basis for the HRS evaluation of the Site (e.g., the HRS documentation 
record with scoresheets and figures, the narrative summary, etc.) and have been made available online at regulations.gov . The 
documents in the EPA Region 10 docket for the Site include the documents in the EPA Headquarters docket along with all 
reference documents identified in the HRS documentation record at proposal.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024

T
his standard is to be applied within the context of the purpose for the National Priorities List; 
i.e., identifying for the States and the public those facilities and sites which appear to warrant 
remedial actions…. Th e standard does not require the Hazard Ranking System to be equivalent to 
detailed risk assessments, quantitative or qualitative, such as might be performed as part of 
remedial actions. This standard requires the Hazard Ranking System to rank sites as accur ately as 
the Agency believes is feasible using information from preliminary assessments and site inspections.... Meeting this standard does not require long- term monitoring or an accurate 
determination of the full nature and extent of contamination at sites or the projected levels of 
exposure such as might be done during remedial investigations and feasibility studies. This provision is intended to ensure that the Hazard Ranking System performs with a degree of 
accuracy appropriate to its role in expeditiously identifying candidate s for respo nse actions . [H.R. 
Rep. No. 962, 99th Cong. 2nd Sess. at 199-200 [1986]]  
 
In addition, the HRS documentation record at proposal explained that other data that were not used in the HRS 
scoring of the Site were available and included in the references supporting the HRS documentation record at proposal. These data were not include d in the scoring or in the body of the HRS documentation record itself due 
to the volume of available data but were available to the public in the HRS documentation record references at the time of proposal. The Site achieved an HRS score sufficient to war rant NPL listing based on the HRS scoring 
presented in the HRS documentation record at proposal and the cited reference documents used to support that scoring. Additional data were not necessary for the HRS scoring of the Site to achieve and NPL -qualifying site 
score but were included in the record for the Site as additional evidence supporting the presence of Site- related 
contamination in sediments. Page 76 of the HRS  documentation record at proposal stated:  
 
Additional Sediment samples confirming an Observed Release by Chemical Analysis :  
 It should be noted that there are additional sediment samples from the 2019 Teck Phase 3 
Sediment Study which meet the criteria for an observed release to surface water; however, they 
were not included due to the sheer volume of data. These samples were not included because they 
were collected near sediment samples already included in documenting an observed release to 
surface water. In addition, the current samples and associated data used resulted in a maximized score of the surface water migration pathway. These sediment samples and associated data are 
included in References 35 and 36.
 
 Moreover, although these additional data provide supplementary information regarding the Site,  these data were 
not necessary to score the Site because the data relied upon sufficiently documented that the Site achieved an 
NPL -eligible HRS site score of 28.50 or greater. As shown throughout this support document, the comments 
submitted have not identified errors in the HRS factor values that would result in the Site score falling below the listing threshold of 28.50. The Site qualifies for addition to the NP L because it has achieved an HRS score greater 
than 28.50, as is demonstrated in the HRS documentation record and this support document. This score is based on the facts presented in the HRS documentation record and this support document. Achieving a site score of 
28.50 or greater indicates that the Site is eligible for inclusion on the NPL and therefore warrants further 
investigation.  
 
Regarding the citizen ’s comments asserting that data tables  were not provided  at proposal, the HRS 
documentation record at proposal included data tables summarizing the data relied on to score relevant HRS factors. The HRS documentation record at proposal was made available to the public on regulations.gov at the 
time of proposal and in the EPA Headquarters and EPA Region 10 dockets. References supporting the HRS scoring of the Site, including source documents for the analytical data, were identified in the HRS documentation 
record at proposal’s reference list and were available to the public, upon request, at the time of proposal via the 
EPA Region 10 Site docket.   
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 17  This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.4 Site Description and Definition 
Comment : Several commenters submitted comments concerning the general description of the Site, and whether 
the Site as scored is consistent with prior EPA communications and investigations. TAI commented that the proposed Site is inconsistent with the EPA’s public communications for moving forward with the proposal for adding the Site to the NPL, which have centered on residential soil contamination. TAI commented that, while 
soil contamination near Northport was emphasized in communications to the public, the HRS documentation 
record at proposal instead focused on the concentration of metals in sediment s. TAI stated that “[i]n fact, EPA 
omitted all but a small portion of the upland areas from the HRS scoring entirely, with the score premised on the Upper Columbia River.”  
 
The Government of Canada commented that the 2006 Settlement Agreement to conduct the RI/FS and a 
description of the ongoing RI/FS should be included in the HRS documentation record and “introductory 
remarks.”  
 Stevens County commented on a perceived difference between the EPA’s communication and the Site as scored, 
stating:  
 
The scoring of this proposal is arbitrary and capricious, or at the very least is skewed to fit the desired outcome of NPL listing as a priority site. We have received no communications on 
contamination on river sediment, yet the scoring to list this site seems to be based on river 
sediment data as opposed to the uplands area where lead levels are a little higher and the ninth 
circuit court of appeals has ruled that air deposition is not the responsibility of the Tech [sic] 
smelter in Canada to clean up and studies have been done. The messaging and purpose of this 
proposed listing is to clean up the higher lead levels in the Uplands Residential areas where 
studies have been conducted and no responsible party exists for clean up of residential properties 
near Northport and the Canadian Border.  Yet this messaging to us local governments and citizens 
throughout the area was only based on the Uplands data.  
 Stevens County also asserted that the EPA’s messaging has focused on lead contamination, while the information 
supporting the proposed listing of the Site includes other compounds and metals in addition to lead.  
 
Response: The HRS documentation record at proposal sufficiently described the Site as evaluated for HRS 
scoring purposes and provided sufficient description for the purpose of identifying the Site for possible NPL placement.  
 As indicated on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, for HRS scoring purposes, the Site is the release of metals  to the Upper Columbia River and soil from former operations at the two smelters , Cominco and 
Le Roi. The Site was described on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal as being located in the northeast portion of Washington State and contaminated due to historical disposal and discharges of wastes and 
emissions from smelter operations, and comingling in soils and surfac e water sediments. Sediments in the river 
are contaminated with slag and metals, including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc, and a significant quantity of slag still remains in the Upper Columbia River. Upland soils at the Site are 
contaminated with metals including arsenic and lead. The HRS evaluation of the Site scored the surface water 
migration pathway based on concentrations of hazardous substances in sediments in the Upper Columbia River 
and the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway based on the concentrations of hazardous substances in soil.  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 18  The Site description presented in the HRS documentation record at proposal was intended to describe the Site 
based on the information used to complete the HRS scoring of the Site. Page 1 of the HRS documentation record 
at proposal elaborated on the location and description of the Site explaining that, “[t] he street address, 
coordinates, and contaminant locations.… represent one or more locations EPA considers to be part of the site 
based on the screening information EPA used to evaluate the site for Nationa l Priorities List (NPL) listing.” The 
description of the Site in the HRS documentation record was also not a final determination of what composes the 
entire Site, because, as also explained on page 1, “HRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release merely 
represent the initial determination that a certain area may need to be addressed under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). ” Regardless of prior descriptions of the 
contamination, the subject of this rule making  is the evaluation of the Site for HRS scoring purposes, which is the 
Site as described in the HRS documentation record at proposal and which meets the HRS definition of a site.   
The Site was properly described  and defined in the HRS documentation record at proposal , consistent with the  
HRS.  For HRS purposes, a site is defined in HRS Section 1.1, Definitions, as: 
  
Area(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has 
otherwise come to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area 
between sources.  
 Page 1 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated that the “EPA lists national priorities among the 
known ‘releases or threatened releases’ of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely delineated boundaries.” Page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal described the specific Site and 
stated that it: 
 
includes for HRS scoring purposes the release of metals from two smelters to the UCR and to soil. The Upper Columbia River site includes three sources: slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter, currently owned by Teck Metals Ltd. (Teck; also referred to 
in references as Teck American Incorporated [TAI]), to the UCR approximately 10 river miles 
(RMs) upstream of the international border in Trail, British Columbia (B.C.); and two sources 
(i.e., contaminated soil and sluice box discharge) associated with the former Le Roi smelter 
located in Northport, Washington.
 
 
This description of the Site meets the criteria of a site as defined by the HRS  and adequately describes the 
contamination as evaluated in the HRS documentation record at proposal.   
As these comments relate to the communication between the EPA and the public, please see section 3.2, Community Involvement, of this support document for a discussion of comments questioning the level of communication with 
the public.  
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.5 Extent of Site 
Comment : Several commenters submitted comments questioning the extent of the proposed Site. Five citizens 
stated that the Site is too extensive, asserting that the Site should be more specific. One other citizen asserted that the extent of the Site should be reduced and should not include the entire 150 miles of the Upper Columbia River from the U.S.-Canada border to the Grand Coulee Dam. Three  citizens commented that the extent of the proposed 
Site is inappropriate due to insufficient data to support the d esignation.  
 
TAI, Stevens County, and the Lincoln County Commissioners (Lincoln County) provided comments discussing 
whether contamination is present in specific areas. TAI asserted that if placed on the NPL, the Site should be Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 19  limited to the Le Roi/Northport smelter facility. In discussing the ongoing investigations, Lincoln County 
commented that “[n]othing of significance has arisen in the lower parts of the lake, all the way to  
Grand Coulee Dam.” Stevens County stated that it disagreed that unidentified properties may require remediation.   
Response: The determination of the extent of the Site for HRS scoring purposes was appropriately established and 
described in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The full extent of site-related contamination, however, is not determined at the listing stage o f the CERCLA  process. The Site  boundaries may change  pending the results 
of further investigation into where the contamination has come to be located. Placing
 a site on the NPL is based 
on an evaluation, in accordance with the HRS, of a release or threatened release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. However, the fact that the EPA initially identifies and lists the release based on a 
review of contamination at a certain parcel of property (or area) does not necessarily mean that the site boundaries 
are limited to that parcel (or area).  
 CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(A) requires the EPA to list national priorities among the known “releases or 
threatened releases” of hazardous substances; thus, the focus is on the release, not precisely delineated boundaries. 
Further, CERCLA Section 101(a) defin es a “facility” as the “site” where a hazardous substance has been 
“deposited, stored, placed, or otherwise come to be located.” The “come to be located” language gives the EPA 
broad authority to clean up contamination when it has spread from the original source. On March 31, 1989 (54 FR 
13298), the EPA stated: 
 
HRS scoring and the subsequent listing of a release merely represent the initial  determination that 
a certain area may need to be addressed under CERCLA. Accordingly, EPA contemplates that the preliminary description of facility boundaries at the time of scoring will need to be refined and 
improved as more information is developed as to where the contamination has come to be 
located; this refining step generally comes during the RI/FS stage. [emphasis added] 
 The revised HRS (55 FR 51587, December 14, 1990) elaborates on the “come to be located” language, defining 
“site” as “area(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has otherwise 
come to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area between the sources.”  
 Until the site investigation process has been completed and a remedial action (if any) selected, the  EPA can 
neither estimate the extent of contamination at the NPL site, nor describe the ultimate dimensions of the site. Even 
during a remedial action (e.g., the removal of buried waste) the EPA may find that the contamination has spread 
further than previously estimated, and the site definition may be correspondingly expanded.  
 
Regarding specific locations with contamination, the Site was defined in the HRS documentation record at proposal based on locations where hazardous substances were located consistent  with the HRS definition of a site. 
Page 1 of the HRS documentation record at proposal explained that the:  
 
contaminant locations presented in this Hazard Ranking System (HRS) documentation record identify the general area the site is located. They represent one or more locations EPA considers 
to be part of the site based on the screening information EPA used to evaluate the site for 
National Priorities List (NPL) listing . 
 
In describing the specifics of the Site being scored, page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated 
that the Site includes, “ the release of metals from two smelters to the UCR and to soil ” and “three sources.” This 
page continued that the three sources include:  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 20  slag historically discharged via outfalls from the Cominco smelter  … to the UCR approximately 
10 river miles (RMs) upstream of the international border in Trail, British Columbia (B.C.); and 
two sources (i.e., contaminated soil and sluice box discharge) associated with the former Le Roi 
smelter . 
 
Page 14 indicated that the three sources “have been documented to contain metals, including antimony, arsenic, 
cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver, zinc, and mercury.” The HRS documentation record at proposal 
explained where the contamination is located (in surface water sediments in the Upper Columbia River and in 
nearby soil) and the specific hazardous substances in the contamination being evaluated. Accordingly, the HRS documentation record at proposal sufficiently identified the extent of the Site f or the purpose of HRS scoring and 
NPL placement. See also section 3.4, Site Description and Definition, of this support document, for further discussion of the Site description.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.6 Comingled Contamination  
Comment : TAI commented that inclusion of the Northport area as part of the Site is inappropriate and 
inconsistent with historical treatment of that area as a separate site. TAI asserted that the EPA’s public 
communications have focused on the soil contamination i n the Northport area which is a separate site unrelated to 
the Cominco  smelter. TAI stated that it disagreed with the inclusion of two separate sites as part of the Upper 
Columbia River site for NPL designation purposes. TAI distinguished the two, s tating that “ the Upper Columbia 
River/Lake Roosevelt Site surrounds the town of Northport, Washington, located approximately 7 river miles downstream of the U.S.- Canada border.” It asserted that Northport has been treated as a separate site in other 
instances, such as the exclusion of the Northport area fro m the  RI/FS residential sampling. TAI commented that 
the scoring approach used could cause “confusion around what ‘the site’ it aims to list actually is.” TAI disagreed with the scoring of the Site based on comingled contamination, stating: 
 
EPA has discretion to score different portions of a site: EPA guidance11 indicates that when 
multiple sources are in an area, the EPA Regional Office must decide whether to treat the area as 
one site or as several sites for HRS scoring purposes.6 EPA Region 10 now apparently considers 
Northport part of the Upper Columbia River/Lake Roosevelt Site, on the basis that emissions from the Trail smelter 20 miles away have “commingled” with contamination from the former Le 
Roi/Northport smelter. TAI disa grees with this assertion based on extensive work done as part of 
the RI/FS, which shows that, as expected, the material impact of aerial emissions from the Trail 
smelter are localized around the smelter in British Columbia and a few miles into Washington .
12 
[61, 61a, 62] 
 
Response : The HRS documentation record at proposal appropriately evaluated the Site as the comingled 
contamination from historical releases associated with the Cominco and Le Roi smelters. While the Site is the comingled contamination from releases from the two smelters, the HRS documentation record at proposal also 
documented that both releases associated with Cominco and Le Roi smelters would independently achieve an 
NPL qualifying HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately (see Appendix A of the HRS 
documentation record at proposal). These independent releases from the two smelters comingled in surface water 
and via air deposition to soil. (See pages 14, 77-78, and 96- 97 of the HRS documentation record at proposal.) 
Therefore, listing this Site as presented in the HRS documentation record at proposal is consistent with the intent

 21  of CERCLA as it evaluates the overlapping threat posed by the comingled releases from the former smelter 
operations.  
 
In discussing the function of the NPL, CERCLA Section 105 (a)(8)(B) (as modified by SARA) directs the establishment of the NPL:  
 
Based upon the criteria set forth in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the President shall list as 
part of the plan national priorities among the known releases or threatened releases throughout the 
United States,... In assembling or revising the nationa l list, the President shall consider any 
priorities established by the states. To the extent practicable, [at least four hundred of] the highest 
priority facilities shall be designated individually and shall be referred to as the “top priority 
among known response targets”  
 Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the National Contingency Plan (NCP) 
include: 
  
[C]riteria  for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United 
States for the purpose of taking remedial action and, to the extent practicable, take into account the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action.  
 To direct implementation of CERCLA (and SARA), the EPA revised the NCP (40 CFR part 300). Section 300.5, Definitions, of the NCP lists the definitions in CERCLA and adds others. It defines the National Priorities List as:  
 
National Priorities List (NPL) means the list, compiled by EPA pursuant to CERCLA section 
105, of uncontrolled hazardous substance releases that are priorities for long- term remedial 
evaluation and response.  
 
The HRS definition of a site is centered on where contamination has come to be located and may include consideration of more than one area. HRS Section 1.1, Definitions , provides the definition for a site and directs 
that a site can include multiple areas. The HRS defines the term site
 as: 
 
Area(s) where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed, or placed, or has 
otherwise come to be located. Such areas may include multiple sources and may include the area 
between sources.  
 
Hence, the focus of the listing is on the release and the EPA has scored the overall comingled release from the 
two smelters based on information available for a complete HRS evaluation. In addition, the EPA provided a 
supplemental scoring in the HRS documentation record at proposal in Appendix A showing each smelter’s release 
would achieve an HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately .  
 As explained throughout the HRS documentation record at proposal, the Site is the release of metals from the two 
smelters ( Cominco  and Le Roi) to the Upper Columbia River and to soil : 
  
• The Site Summary section on page 14 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed that the Site includes for HRS scoring purposes the release of metals from two smelters to the Upper Columbia 
River and to soil . It identified that releases from the three scored sources (Cominco slag discharges, Le 
Roi sluice box discharges, and contaminated soil at the former Le Roi facility) have resulted in comingled 
contamination in the Upper Columbia River. It also identified aerial deposition released from both 
smelters has become comingled in the AOC soil contamination.  
• The Attribution section for the surface water migration pathway on pages 77-78 of the HRS 
documentation record at proposal discussed the nearly continuous contamination in the 35- mile stretch of Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 22  the river encompassing the zone of contamination scored, and the comingling of the two smelters’ 
releases to surface water at and downstream of the Le Roi smelter.  
• The Attribution section for the soil exposure component on pages 96-97 of the HRS documentation 
record  at proposal discussed airborne emissions from the two smelters, including operations/emissions 
from Le Roi and air quality/deposition modeling and analysis for emissions from the Cominco smelter to 
the greater Upper Columbia River Basin over an 85- year period.  
 The inclusion  of the Northport area within the scope of  the S ite in the NPL listing is appropriate. The EPA 
conducted a removal site evaluation of the Le Roi s melter  in 2003 and a removal action in 2004. The RI/FS work 
did not begin until after the removal action at Le Roi s melter  began. Thus, the  Le Roi smelter location of the  2003 
removal action was, at that time, considered a separate site. The purpose of the RI/FS for the Upper Columbia 
River site is to determine the nature and extent of contamination, which includes the Le Roi smelter . In 2015, T AI 
disputed a direction from  the EPA and, as part of the dispute resolution, the EPA agreed to reduce the area of soil 
sampling T AI was required to do. The EPA did not require T AI to sample in the Northport town proper in 2016. 
However, the EPA did not exclude Northport from any future sampling or  response action s. 
 As noted above, both the Cominco and Le Roi smelter  releases would independently achieve an NPL qualifying 
HRS site score of 28.50 or greater if scored separately. While both smelters independently achieve an NPL 
eligible HRS site score, the threat to the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure and subsurface 
intrusion pathway is the result of comingled releases from the operations at the smelters.   
 TAI’s claim that aerial emissions from the Cominco smelter are localized around the smelter in British Columbia 
and a few miles into Washington is incorrect . TAI cites its October 2023 Upper Columbia River Draft Final 
Remedial Investigation Report for OU 3 as the  basis for  these statements. The EPA disapproved this report on 
April 9, 2024, for multiple reasons includ ing TAI ’s mistaken assertions concerning  the geographic limitation of 
aerial metals emissions from the Cominco  smelter.  The full extent of the upland soil contamination is not known, 
and the EPA is pursuing further investigations.   
Finally, even if the comingling of Cominco/Le Roi releases in contamination in the soil at Northport were not 
considered and the soil exposure component were not scored, the Site would still achieve an NPL- qualifying HRS 
site score of 28.50 or greater base d solely on the comingled surface water contamination and the surface water 
migration pathway score (i.e., the surface water migration pathway yields a pathway score of 100.00, which would result by itself in a site score of 50.00).  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.7 Liability 
Comment: TAI, Stevens County, and two citizens commented on the presence of PRPs and/or liability for the 
contamination scored. TAI commented that some of the upland soil contamination along the Upper Columbia 
River is related to impacts from the Le Roi/Northport  smelter and unrelated to the Cominco  smelter and Teck. 
TAI asserted that as the release associated with the Le/Roi Smelter lacks a solvent PRP, the Site should be limited to the impacts from the Le Roi smelter. TAI commented that following the Settlement Agreement, Teck has made 
continual progress on the RI/FS. Stevens County stated that a PRP is not present for the residential soil 
contamination around Northport. Additionally, two citizens commented that involvement from Canada is needed to address the issue as contamination is coming from Canada.  
 
Response : The NPL listing process is separate from a determination of liability, and liability is not considered in 
evaluating a site under the HRS. The NPL serves primarily as an informational tool for use by the EPA in identifying those sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health or the environment. Listing a site on 
the NPL does not reflect a judgment on the activities of the owner(s) or operator(s) of a site. It does not require Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 23  those persons to undertake any action, nor does it assign any liability to any person. This position, stated in the 
legislative history of CERCLA, has been explained more fully in the Federal Register  (48 FR 40674, September 
8, 1983, and 53 FR 23988, June 24, 1988). See Kent County v. EPA, 963 F.2d 391 (D.C. Cir. 1992  Furthermore, the presence or absence of a PRP (solvent or otherwise) or the absence of involvement from other 
parties are not factors considered in determining whether to place a site on the NPL . Evaluating whether this Site 
is eligible for proposal to the NPL is based on the technical analysis set forth in the HRS and explained in the HRS documentation record at proposal. Comments about funding for site remediation are addressed in section 
3.8, Funding, of this support document.  
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.8 Funding 
Comment: TAI, Stevens County, Benton County, and several citizens submitted comments discussing sources and 
uses of funding for remedial work.  
 
TAI commented that an RI/FS is ongoing and fully funded. TAI asserted that if NPL designation is pursued, then 
the Site should be limited to the Le Roi/Northport smelter due to its lack of a solvent PRP.   
TAI asserted that while the EPA’s news release about the proposed addition of the Site to the NPL suggested that 
NPL placement allows the EPA access to funding via the Superfund program, the process of NPL designation 
only makes non- federal sites eligible for federal funding, and that NPL listing makes sites eligible for this funding 
but does not guarantee it. TAI commented that: 
 
• Only non-federal sites are eligible for funding via the Superfund program following placement on the 
NPL.  
• Other funding mechanisms are required to be pursued by the NCP prior financing remedial actions via the Superfund.  
• Actual funding via the Superfund program is determined through specific prioritization factors. 
• This Site is unlikely to be prioritized for funding due to the limited risk posed by the Site compared other sites.  
• Funding, if awarded, may not be immediately available.  
 
Stevens County, Benton County, and five  citizens asserted that the motivation behind the pursuit of an NPL 
designation for the Site is to obtain funding. Stevens County stated that it disagreed that adding the entire area to the NPL would result in funding for remedial actions. Stevens County st ated that “references to tapping into IIJA 
[Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ] dollars” for this Site have been made. Five citizens asserted that 
including this Site on the NPL would be an inappropriate use of tax dollars. One citizen commented that funding should be in the form of grants to allow the community to make improvements that will work at a local level. Five 
citizens commented that political power associated with funding is another motivation behind the placement of the Site on the NPL. One citizen asserted that placing the Site on the NPL could become a major cost to 
taxpayers. Benton County asserted that the idea that NPL listing will lead to cleanup funding is flawed because it 
is based on the assumption that public health/environmental concerns will be identified (which is inconsistent 
with RI/FS findings so far).  
 
Response: Insomuch as these comments are related to sources of funding for future or ongoing remedial activities, 
sources of funding for remedial activities are not a factor considered in evaluating whether the NPL placement of a site is warranted. The costs associated with future or ongoing remedial actions are not determined as part of the Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 24  listing stage of the CERCLA process. The discussion of costs in NPL rules in the Federal Register  clearly states 
that including a site on the NPL does not cause the EPA necessarily to undertake remedial action; it does not 
require any action by a private party, nor does it assign liability for site response costs (56 FR 21462, May 9, 
1991). The cost discussion outlines the EPA’s perception of average potential costs per site that may occur in association with events generally following the proposed listing of a site. Any EPA actions that may impose costs 
on entitie s are based on discretionary decisions and are made on a case-by- case basis. Also, responsible parties 
may bear some or all the costs of the RI/FS and subsequent work, or the costs may be shared by the EPA and the 
States. Therefore, expenditures cited by the commenter are associated with events that generally follow  listing the 
site, not with the listing itself. The EPA has not allocated costs for this Site at this time.   
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.9 Economic Impact and Stigma of Listing 
Comment : Stevens County, Lincoln County, SCBID , QCBID , ECBID , and 21 citizens expressed concern 
regarding potential economic impacts to the region. In discussing possible economic impacts, Stevens County, QCBID, SCBID, ECBID, and 10 citizens expressed concern for one or more of the following:  
 
• Possible decreases in property values  
• Possible changes in taxation and/or shifting tax burdens  
• Negative impacts to local business  
• Decreases in local tourism and/or local recreation  
• Impacts to agriculture and/or global trade markets for food products  
 The SCBID, QCBID, ECBID, and one citizen also stated that because local farms irrigate crops with water from 
the Columbia River, crops from the region may be stigmatized resulting in negative economic impacts to 
agriculture businesses. The SCBID, QCBID, and ECBID also asserted that the resulting decreases to agriculture businesses could cascade and affect national food supply and/or global trade markets.  
 
In addition, four citizens commented that economic concerns could occur, asserting  previous economic impacts 
have occurred to the local industry (e.g., logging) because  of the protection of the spotted owl as an endangered 
species.  
 
Response: The EPA notes that there are both costs and benefits that can be associated with listing a site. The 
potential stigma and economic impacts identified by the commenters, however, are not considered in the 
assessment of whether a site belongs on the NPL. Such impacts are not the result of NPL listing. Instead, potential negative impacts associated with listing the Site, as noted by the commenter, would be engendered by the 
contamination in the area, not by placing the Site on the NPL. Furthermore, inclusion of a site or facility on the 
NPL reflects the EPA’s judgment that a significant release or threat of release has occurred and that the site is a 
priority for further investigation under CERCLA.  
 Among the benefits associated with listing a site are increased health and environmental protection as a result of 
increased public awareness of potential hazards. In addition to the potential for federally financed remedial actions, the addition of a site to the NPL could accelerate privately financed, v oluntary cleanup efforts. Listing 
sites as national priority targets also can give States increased support for funding responses at particular sites. As 
a result of the additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower human exposure to high- risk chemicals, and 
access to higher quality surface water, groundwater , soil , and air . Therefore, it is possible that any perceived or 
actual negative fluctuations in property values, stigma, or development opportunities that may result from 
contamination may also be countered by positive fluctuations when a CERCLA investigation and any ne cessary 
cleanup are completed. For further information, see information in the September 2000 EPA fact sheet, Superfund Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 25  Today, How Can a Superfund Site Affect My Property? (EPA 540 -F-98-001, available at 
https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/927384.pdf ).  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  
3.10 Purpose of Listing 
Comment: TAI, Stevens County, Lincoln County, QCBID, SCBID, ECBID, the Rimrock Cabin Owners 
Association, and several citizens submitted comments discussing the purpose and rationale for listing.  
 
Purpose of NPL Listing  
TAI requested that the purpose of listing be clarified, including the benefits and limitations. TAI asserted that 
statements have been made that incorrectly suggest that additional enforcement authority is provided via NPL 
placement and that these types of  statements provide misinformation about the status of a proposed NPL site. TAI 
commented that NPL designation does not provide additional enforcement authority. TAI commented that a Washington State Department of Ecology staff member made a statement sugg esting that an NPL designation for 
the Site would end an ongoing litigation.
13  
 
TAI stated that an RI/FS is ongoing for this Site in contrast to most sites, which are typically considered for NPL placement at the preliminary assessment (PA) stage. TAI commented that HRS scoring is a site evaluation process 
intended “for a relatively q uick, limited assessment based on high- level data available in the early days of 
understanding the site.” It asserted that HRS scoring is not intended to account for extensive site- specific data. 
TAI stated that the HRS Guidance Manual notes that HRS score s are intended to reflect the threat at the time of 
scoring. TAI commented that the ongoing RI/FS will determine the need for remedial action and the specific 
actions necessary.  
 Need for Listing  
Several commenters provided comments discussing whether a need for listing the Site on the NPL had been established. F ive citizens commented that a need for the proposed NPL designation of the Site had not been 
provided. In discussing results of prior investigations, Lincoln County commented that no significant issues have 
been found for lower parts of Lake Roosevelt to the Grand Coulee Dam. A citizen commented that it is unclear 
what remediation of the Site will accomplish.  Three citizens asserted that the designation appeared to be 
motivated by the pursuit of funding. Three citizens also commented that a Superfund designation will shift 
political power over a large part of Eastern Washington to the State and local tribes. A citizen asserted that 
without coordination with the Government of Canada, the issue of contamination in the Upper Columbia River 
will remain. The QCBID, SCBID, and ECBID asserted that alternative approaches to remediate the soil 
contamination that are being identified in the RI/FS should  be pursued. Lincoln County commented that 
alternatives should be pursued to address issues identified in the lower portion of Lake Roosevelt.   Stevens County asserted that NPL placement of the Site is premature and the process of completing the RI/FS 
prior to placing the Site on the NPL should be followed. Stevens County commented that the process should also 
be followed because the new EPA guida nce on lead levels in soil is inconsistent with the screening levels for 
metals in Washington state. Stevens County asserted that placing the Site on the NPL at this time would eliminate the determination of whether remedial work would exacerbate the threat to human health and public safety. It also 
commented that NPL placement at this stage would eliminate the examination of which remedial methods are 
most appropriate.  
 
 
13 TAI points to statements made by Brook Beeler, Eastern Regional Manager at the Washington State Department of 
Ecology, as shown in an article from the Roll Call newspaper, available at https://rollcall.com/2024/04/10/superfund- plan-
for-columbia -river -sparks -debate- in-northwest/ .  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 26  One citizen commented that other areas may be in a greater need of remediation and funding for remediation. 
Another citizen asserted that listing would cause adverse public health impacts as a result of an economic 
downturn.  
 Remedy Decision/ Remedial Actions  
The Rimrock Cabin Owners Association and 14 citizens submitted comments providing suggested remedial actions. These concerns about future remediation from the Rimrock Cabin Owners Association and the citizens 
included comments that:  
 
• Remediation of the sediment in the Columbia River could lead to a greater exposure to contamination if sediment is disturbed.  
• Additional unbiased testing to determine high levels of contamination should occur before remediation begins.  
• Documentation that the proposed remedial work will result in improved conditions should be required.  
• Unique solutions for remediation and additional planning should be considered.  
• Smelters should be shut down and modified.  
• Instead of removing the dam, adding fish ladders is a more appropriate mitigation approach and will not impact agriculture in the area.  
• Remedial work should be focused on a specific area as opposed to a broader geographic area.  
• Remedial work could negatively impact the lake and river area.  
• Cleanup should be completed on an area-specific basis accounting for the risk to human health or 
wildlife.  
 
Response : The purpose of listing a site on the NPL is to inform the public of a possible threat posed by a site that 
warrants further investigation. The EPA’s actions to evaluate the Upper Columbia River site using the HRS and 
listing the Site are consistent with the requirements of CERCLA and SARA, and the statutory purpose of the 
NPL.  
 
Placing the Site on the NPL is not an announcement of any site- specific risk level or a determination of the need 
for remedial action. Listing a site reflects the EPA’s decision to inform the public of the possible threat posed by the site and at a later stage in the CERCLA  process the EPA will determine what, or if, cleanup  action is 
warranted. An HRS site score above 28.50 for the Upper Columbia River site represents the EPA’s determination that the Site poses a relative risk as compared to other sites evaluated under the HRS and that the Site warrants further investigation  and potential remediation. At this Site, hazardous substances, including antimony, arsenic, 
cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, zinc, and mercury, were identified in a release to surface water, and lead and arsenic were identified in contaminated soil ; the relative risk posed by this contamination is reflected in the HRS 
scoring of the surface water migration pathway and soil exposure component in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The contamination documented in sediments and surface soil has the potential to affect human health 
and/or the environment. The need for remedial action to address the sediment and soil contamination will be assessed during later stages of the CERCLA process.  
 
Purpose of NPL Listing  
The NPL is generally intended to be a “rough list” of prioritized hazardous sites; a “first step in a process —
nothing more, nothing less.” Eagle Picher Indus. v. EPA, 759 F.2d 922, 932 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Eagle Picher II). 
The HRS is the mechanism used to evaluate the relative risk of a site. If a site scores 28.50 or greater using the HRS, then it may be added to the NPL.  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 27  The purpose of NPL listing is explained in the Federal Register  Notice of February 21, 1990 (Volume 55, 
Number 35), excerpted below:  
 
The purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informational and management 
tool. The initial identification of a site for the NPL is intended primarily to guide EPA in 
determining which sites warrant further investigation to assess the nature and extent of the public 
health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA -financed 
remedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves to notify the public of si tes 
EPA believes warrant further investigation.  
 
Addition of the Site to the NPL thus indicates further investigation is warranted to fully assess the extent of risk 
posed by the Site (and remedial actions may be selected based on the findings of that complete assessment).  
 Need  for Listing  
Sufficient basis for placing the Site on the NPL has been established. The Site qualifies for addition to the NPL because it has achieved an HRS score equal to or greater than 28.50, as is demonstrated in the HRS documentation record and this support document. Achieving a site score of 28.50 or greater indicates that the Site  
is eligible for inclusion on the NPL and therefore warrants further investigation. Placing a site on the NPL allows the EPA to more effectively prioritize sites and manage possible fut ure site investigations  and response actions; it 
also notifies the public that the release at a site is of concern to the Agency. The HRS score for the Site is based on the release of contamination documented in sediment s in the surface water migration pathway and soil 
contamination in the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, the 
contaminants present, and the targets subject to actual and potential contamination, consistent with th e HRS. The 
HRS site score above 28.50 presents sufficient need for NPL placement and establishes that the Site poses sufficient relative risk to warrant further investigation.  As explained in detail in section 3.15, Risk to Human 
Health and the Environment, of this support document, the HRS evaluation of a site is not a risk assessment and 
not intended to provide a specific determination of risk. Rather, the specific risk posed by the Site is determined at 
a separate stage in the CERCLA  process.  
 Remedy Decision/ Remedial Actions  
Placement of a site on the NPL is not an evaluation of the effectiveness of any remedy currently in place or a 
determination of whether specific remedial actions are appropriate. T he EPA has a procedure for identifying sites 
where releases of substances addressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the 
NPL, evaluating the nature and extent of the threats at such sites, responding to those threats, and deleting sites 
from the NPL.  The evaluation, or RI/FS phase, involves on- site testing to assess the nature and extent of the 
public health and environmental risks associated with the site, and provides information to determine what 
remedial actions, if any, may be appropriate. After a period of public comment, the EPA responds to those threats 
by issuing a Record of Decision that selects the most appropriate alternative. The selected remedy is implemented 
during the remedial design/remedial action phase. Finally, the site may be  deleted from the NPL when the EPA 
determines that no furt her response is appropriate.  
 
While the steps in the CERCLA  process are distinct, they can be conducted in parallel. For the Upper Columbia 
River site, the Site was evaluated using the HRS and received an HRS site score of 51.15, which exceeds the 
threshold for placement on the NPL. Because of an NPL eligible HRS site score, in conjunct ion with concurrence 
from the state of Washington , the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation,  and The Spokane Tribe of 
Indians , the EPA proposed the Site for listing on the NPL. Prior to proposi ng the Site on the NPL, to address the 
Site in a more timely manner, the EPA has been overseeing the conduct of an RI/FS by a PRP to evaluate the Site 
in more depth to characterize site contamination and to analyze interim remedial alternatives to address the most 
pressing threats at the Site. The EPA has also conducted or overseen implementation of time critical removal Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 28  actions to address immediate threats to public health.14 As a matter of policy, however, the EPA does not delay 
NPL listing of a site to incorporate any new data or to score new pathways if the ultimate listing decision is not 
affected.  
 
As previously noted in this support document, the selection of remedy—if any is found necessary  for some or all 
of the Site —and any associated funding is a step carried out at a later stage of the CERCLA  process.  Thus, 
comments on a remedy are premature at the listing stage.  However, placing the Site on the NPL does not prohibit 
any PRP or stakeholder from participating in cleanup efforts  as discussed in detail in section 3.14, Ongoing 
Investigation and Remediation, of this support document. The ongoing RI/FS is also discussed further in that 
section.  
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.11 Due Process  
Comment: Stevens County stated that information has been delayed or withheld to move forward with the listing 
process. Stevens County asserted that comments were solicited from select groups on the draft BERA, which is used to support some aspects of the NPL proposal of the Site. It commented that Citizens for Clean Columbia 
were provided an opportunity to comment prior to the release of the draft document, while local governments 
were not given the same opportunity to comment.  
 Stevens County also stated that the “solicitation of clean up action contracting for this process under the CERCLA 
program and NPL”
15 prior to the proposal to list the Site on the NPL suggests that “this rule- making process has a 
predetermined outcome without affording the process follow all federal guidelines.” Stevens County quoted the 
solicitation, which, in part, states: 
 
R10 Upper Columbia River Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7, Acquisition Management Branch, is seeking 
the services of an experienced firm to provide Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support services within the Upper Columbia River (UCR) Site. The primary focus of this requirement will 
be on residential properties within the Town of Northport that are affected by commingled 
contamination from smelter operations.… To achieve this, work includes: 1) an additional round 
of voluntary soil sampling at properties that have not been previously sampled; 2) complete a 
removal assessment and prioritization of properties for cleanup using data obtained during the 
current and previous sampling events; and 3) conduct time critical removal actions (TCRA) at the 
properties identified for cleanup. [A12]  
 
Response: The EPA correctly followed the HRS, complied with the requirements in the APA, and followed 
relevant procedures in determining whether to list  the Site on the NPL. The EPA has concluded that placing the 
Site on the NPL is an appropriate step in the multi- step CERCLA process.  
 
Consistent with CERCLA, the EPA has in place a procedure for identifying sites where releases of substances 
addressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the NPL, evaluating the nature and 
extent of the threats at such sites, res ponding to those threats, and deleting sites from the NPL. The purpose of the 
initial two steps is to develop the NPL, which identifies for the States and the public those sites that appear to

discussion in the section titled “Residential cleanups” (as well as planning for future actions in the section “ EPA to conduct 
time-critical removal/soil cleanup action ”). 
15 Stevens County point ed to a solicitation located at: 
https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/default.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2ffedconnect%3fdoc%3d68HE0724R0014%26agency%3
dEPA&doc=68HE0724R0014&agency=EPA   Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 29  warrant remedial action (56 FR 35842, July 29, 1991). The evaluation or RI/FS phase involves on- site testing to 
assess the nature and extent of the public health and environmental risks associated with the site and to determine 
what alternatives for remedi al action, if any, may be appropriate. After a period of public comment following 
issuance of the RI/FS and the identification of a preferred alternative, the EPA responds to the identified threats 
by issuing a Record of Decision which selects the most appropriate alternative. The selected remedy is 
implemented during the remedial design/remedial action phase. Finally, the site may be deleted from the NPL 
when the EPA determines that no further response is appropriate.   
 This process encourages and relies on the participation of the public, including PRPs. The public can comment 
during the comment period (typically 60 days) after a site is proposed for listing and during the time the EPA is 
evaluating and selecting a remed y (the EPA may also hold a public hearing during the latter decision- making 
period). If private parties conduct a remedial action under a consent decree between the EPA and the parties, the 
decree is also subject to public comment. The EPA believes that th e above process offers the public sufficient 
opportunity to present facts and opinions germane to its decision- making.   
 
Additionally, the CERCLA  process allows the Agency to include expedited removal actions and interim measures 
to address more immediate concerns or address portions of a site. The EPA may select removal actions (such as a 
TCRA) at any time to address immediate risks to human health. (See CERCLA Section 10 4.) 
 
As further detailed in section 3.3, Adequacy of Documentation, of this support document, on the subject of the 
BERA , whether the BERA forms part of the basis for listing and the lack of opportunity for local governments to 
comment on the BERA, the HRS evaluation and HRS site score is fully supported by the references in the HRS 
documentation record at proposal , and the draft BERA is not needed to support the HRS score. The public was 
provided a 60- day comment period to review and comment on all documents supporting the listing decision,  
including the HRS documentation record at proposal and supporting references. The BERA was not included as a  
reference to the HRS documentation record at proposal  and is not needed to support the HRS score. Whether 
another group may have had an opportunity to evaluate a document not relied upon for the proposed listing of the Site is unrelated to the present listing action.  
 Regarding the solicitation identified by the commenter (“solicitation of clean up action”), the solicitation 
summary quoted above is looking for services to complete Sampling and Removal Action Technical Support 
services. Removal action support services can occur separately and be unrelated to the evaluation of whether 
placing a site on the NPL is appropriate. As identified in the HRS documentation record at proposal, removal 
actions have been conducted to address soil contamination in and around the Northport area. The volume of 
contaminated soil removed at those locations was not included in the Site for HRS scoring purposes.  Page 92 of 
the HRS documentation record at proposal explained that the “EPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area dating back to 2003,” and for the evaluation of “the hazardous waste quantity area 
and resident population for the AOC … only contaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did 
not have soil removals, were included in the calculation.” Thus, this solicitation is unrelated to the HRS 
documentation record and does not impact the site score or affect the assessment of whether placement on the 
NPL is appropriate.  Note that NPL listing allows for  CERCLA remedial action, which is different from a removal 
action (i.e., as set out in 42 U.S.C. § 9601(24), a remedial action is generally considered to include those actions 
taken that are consistent with a permanent remedy ); also, CERCLA removal actions may occur at any time on 
sites that are either on , or not on, the NPL.   
 The solicitation  referred to by the commenter  was issued to ensure that contract services are in place to support 
additional removal site evaluation and removal actions , should they be determined to be necessary, at properties 
where potential immediate  risk exists.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 30  3.12 Delay Listing Until the RI/FS is Completed 
Comment: Stevens County, the Eastern Washington Council of Governments (EWCOG), Lincoln County, 
QCBID, SCBID, ECBID, Benton County, and 22  citizens stated that placement of the Site on the NPL should not 
occur prior to the completion of an RI/FS or other similar investigation. Stevens County and one  citizen 
commented that the EPA previously stated that the Site would not be placed on the NPL until after the RI/FS is 
completed. One citizen asserted that the 2006 settlement agreement with Teck mandated certain studies be completed before NPL listing . [C15] EWCOG stated that, as a high concern is not present, delaying listing “will 
not have a detrimental effect.”  
 
Stevens County asserted that the RI/FS is ongoing, would be complete in a few years, and should be completed as 
soon as possible. Stevens County stated that placing the Site on the NPL after the RI/FS would:  
• Ensure “ reliable science- based studies to confirm there is/was an issue needing clean up”  
• Identify “specific areas for clean -up where the cleanup action would not create more harm than benefit”  
 
Stevens County and several  citizens submitted comments discussing whether the Site should be placed on the 
NPL prior to the collection of data and information from additional reports. Eight citizens stated that it is unclear 
why NPL designation is occurring without the scientific data that would result from the RI/FS. Stevens County commented that  it is unclear why NPL designation is being pursued for the entire waterbody as an EPA 
representative indicated that Lake Roosevelt meets drinking water standards except for bacteria, which have not been tested for. Stevens County asserted that pursuing listing prior to completion of the RI/FS would eliminate the 
assessment of whether remedial efforts may have negative effects and identifying which cleanup methods are 
appropriate. Stevens County commented that an FS needs to be completed to limit exposure during cleanup. 
Stevens County stated that the RI/FS investigation for ecologic health is funded and that completed human health 
studies are indicating no actions a re needed. One citizen commented that the RI/FS will provide information about 
the best remedial approach.  
 
In a letter provided to the EPA included as Attachment A to its comment submission, Stevens County requested 
that NPL listing be reconsidered. Stevens County also stated that if the EPA were to pursue an “NPL Listing 
(Superfund Designation) without completing the RI/FS studies first, you leave us with no other option but to challenge your actions in court.”  
 
Response : There is no need to delay NPL listing to wait for the results of the RI/FS investigation.  All site 
investigation work performed  to date or currently proceeding, including the ongoing RI/FS, will be considered in 
subsequent steps of the CERCLA process. The available information presented in the HRS documentation record 
at proposal establishes an HRS site score exceeding the 28.50 threshold and qualifying the Site for NPL listing 
based on the current conditions at the Site. Site -related contamination remains in sediment s and soil as 
documented in the HRS documentation record at proposal. The EPA has determined that this site- related 
contamination appears to warrant further investigation and potential remediation. Other ongoing investigations do 
not negate the need for listing. Nevertheless, the results of the Upper Columbia River RI/FS will be taken into account as part of later stages of the CERCLA process for the Site.   
 As previously indicated in section 3.11, Due Process, of this support document , and  consistent with CERCLA, the 
EPA has in place a procedure for identifying sites where releases of substances addressed under CERCLA have occurred or may occur, placing such sites on the NPL, evaluating the nature and extent of the threats at such sites, responding to those threats, and deleting sites f rom the NPL. The purpose of the initial two steps is to develop the 
NPL which identifies for the States and the public those sites that appear to warrant further investigation and 
potential remedial action. The evaluation or RI/FS phase involves on- site te sting to define the nature and extent of 
the threat posed by the contamination and to identify alternatives for remedial action. The RI/FS investigation Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 31  typically occurs following listing on the NPL. (However, as noted in section 3.10, Purpose of Listing, of this 
support document, for this Site, the RI/FS has been ongoing and is proceeding in parallel with NPL listing.)  
 
Thus, the purpose of NPL listing is to identify sites warranting further investigation to fully assess the extent of 
risk posed by the site (and ultimately to evaluate and determine what CERCLA- financed remedial actions, if any, 
may be appropriate). The RI/FS identifies the extent of contamination and possible remedies to address that contamination. In this case, both steps are being done concurrently, as there is a party conducting an RI/FS 
pursuant to a settlement agreement, and, at the same time, there i s sufficient information available to justify NPL 
listing.  
 Regarding the data and documentation used to evaluate and score the Site with the HRS, sufficient data and 
documentation were used for the purposes of HRS scoring as explained in detail in section 3.3, Adequacy of 
Documentation, of this support document.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.13 Consistency with Guidance/Use of Guidance 
Comment: TAI and Stevens County submitted comments questioning aspects of EPA guidance documents and 
the application of guidance:  
 
• TAI asserted that the HRS Guidance Manual  indicates that, when addressing an area with multiple 
sources, the EPA can use its discretion to determine whether one or more sites is present for HRS scoring purposes. TAI commented that it disagreed with the EPA’s consideration of the Le Roi  smelter as a part 
of the Site due to comingling of releases.  
• In discussing EPA guidance developed using an extrapolation of Center for Disease Control (CDC) 
guidance for blood lead levels, Stevens County commented that prior blood lead studies:  
show NO elevated lead levels in children, the most vulnerable population, from the old standards prior to the new guidance. As guidance is simply that and has not been 
available for public comment, and extrapolation of data is a scientific guess with no degree [of] certainty, it draws the conclusion that lead levels of blood in the children and 
population in the area should be done prior to scoring being completed to show there is 
an issue. Scoring should be done on known risks, not guesses by those in the agency.…  
• TAI commented on the EPA’s new lead screening level guidance. It pointed to a March 5, 2024, EPA 
news release
16 in which the EPA noted that soil at more than 194 residential areas related to the Site 
involve lead at levels that exceed the new EPA screening level for residential lead contamination . TAI 
commented that guidance for the new screening level does not prescribe cleanup levels (and that site-
specific screening levels are already set).  
 
• TAI asserted that the HRS Guidance Manual indicates that releases are scored based on the threat at the 
time of scoring.  
 
Response : The EPA followed the HRS regulation to list the Site on the NPL. Furthermore, unlike the HRS 
regulation itself, the HRS Guidance Manual  and other EPA guidance are not regulations and impose no 
mandatory requirements on the Agency.  
 
 
16 The news release is available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -wa-
superfund- list.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 32  Regardless, the Interim Final  HRS Guidance Manual was also applied appropriately in the HRS evaluation based 
on the facts and circumstances known to be present for this Site at proposal; any variation in applying the HRS 
Guidance Manual  was carried out to reflect site-specific conditions. The  HRS Guidance Manual states that:  
 
[t]he procedures set forth in this document are intended as guidance to employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), States, and other government agencies. EPA officials 
may decide to follow the guidance provided in this directive, or to ac t at variance with it, based 
on analysis of specific site circumstances.  
 In evaluating whether a site merits NPL listing, the EPA complies with the HRS and uses the HRS Guidance 
Manual as just that—guidance to determine how best to perform the HRS evaluation based on the facts or 
circumstances presented at each site. The HRS Guidance Manual is consistent with the HRS (this was not 
challenged by the commenters), and the EPA has followed the HRS in scoring the Site and applied the  HRS 
Guidance Manual , as appropriate, depending on the facts presented by this Site.  
 
Regarding the consideration of the Le Roi smelter as a part of the Site due to comingling of releases, the Site was 
appropriately evaluated as the comingled contamination from historical releases associated with the Cominco and 
Le Roi smelters  as discussed in detail in section 3.6, Commingled Contamination, of this support document.  
 Regarding consistency with the draft EPA’s Updated Residential Soil Lead Guidance for CERCLA Sites and 
RCRA Corrective Action Facilities
17 guidance document, this document is intended to only provide 
recommendations and present guidance on evaluating sites at stages unrelated to the listing stage of the CERCLA  
process. This guidance document provides residential soil lead regional screening levels (RSLs) and regional removal management levels (RMLs), which are used during other stages of the CERCLA  process for remedial 
and removal actions. Further, these screening levels are not used in the HRS evaluation and therefore have no impact on the HRS score.   
Regarding the absence of elevated blood lead levels, the HRS does not require blood lead sampling in scoring 
sites for NPL listing  nor require inclu sion of blood lead levels directly in  any of the HRS factors. Additionally, the 
EPA also  does  not require , or encourage, blood lead sampling for CERCLA risk assessments as indicated in EPA 
guidance.
18 The EPA ’s mission is to protect human health and the environment by prevent ing adverse health 
effects from pollution . The EPA does not require evidence of elevated blood lead levels before HRS scoring  of a 
site or taking actions to protect human health. Please see section, 3.15, Risk to Human Health and the 
Environment, of this support document for additional discussion of blood lead level studies.  
 
Regarding the comments suggesting that a determination of a specific level of risk associated with the Site be made, as noted above, the Site was evaluated using the HRS regulation which is a screening tool intended to 
provide a limited evaluation of a sit e. The determination of site- specific risk occurs at a separate stage of the 
CERCLA process, and comments discussing the possible risk posed by the Site are addressed in section 3.15, Risk to Human Health or the Environment, of this support document.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.14 Ongoing Investigation and Remediation  
Comment: TAI, the Government of Canada, and two citizens commented that extensive remediation and 
investigation of the Site have occurred and are ongoing. TAI commented that an RI/FS is ongoing, the BERA is

Corrective Action Sites , is available online at https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/11/100000158 . Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
33 ongoing, and the human health risk assessment (HHRA) has been completed. TAI stated that the HRS “ approach  
largely does not account for the extensive RI/FS work already done.” As part of the comments provided by TAI 
on the robust nature of the remedial work Teck has been completing, it commented that:  
•Th
e HHRA indicated that unacceptable levels of contamination are not present in surface water and fish
from the Upper Columbia River.
•Many of the residential properties with lead -contaminated soil above the EPA action levels have been
remediated.
•The work completed as part of the ongoing RI/FS included a Tribal consumption and use survey and arecreational use survey.
•The draft BERA for the aquatic portion of the Site has been submitted and is a comprehensive aquaticecologic risk assessment
•Analysis of thousands of samples from the Site has occurred.
•Multiple types of environmental media have been sampled and assessed.
TA
I and the Government of Canada submitted comments pointing to the ongoing RI/FS. The Government of 
Canada stated that “[i]t is expected that the results included in these reports will provide essential data on the 
extent and magnitude of risks as well as identify data gaps for future studies,” and it noted that a hydro-dynamic 
model may provide additional data regarding the transport of slag in the river. The Government of Canada 
requested that the nature and extent of the completed and on- going remedial work be clearly stated. TAI also 
stated that “the nature and necessity of any final remedial action will be determined on a site- specific basis in the 
RI/FS.” It commented that the aquatic RI report is ongoing and the FS and Records of Decision will occur following the RI.
19  
As p
art of its comments regarding the extensive remedial work completed for the Site and the evaluation of the 
Site, TAI asserted that the HRS is an inappropriate tool for evaluating a site with extensive completed remedial 
work and available data. TAI stated that while evaluating NPL placement in the early stages of site assessment is 
appropriate,20 the function of listing to serve as a quick and inexpensive tool21 for assessing sites does not apply to 
a site like the Upper Columbia River, which already has extensive data and an ongoing RI/FS. It commented that unlike this Site where investigation has been occurring for 20 years, NPL placement usually occurs early i n the 
site evaluation process. It asserted that NPL placement typically also does not occur where a funded on -going 
RI/FS is occurring. 
TA
I commented that while the EPA’s stated primary concern is reducing residential exposure to lead in soil, the 
EPA also noted that NPL listing would not change the process, investigation, or remediation, culminating in the 
remediation of both upland soil and aquatic areas associated with the Site.22 In discussing the remediation process, 
TAI commented that an RI/FS is already mandated as part of a Settlement Agreement between EPA and Teck.  
Response : The  EPA has determined that listing the Site on the NPL is the next appropriate step in the CERCLA 
process. Future remedial actions are not considered during the HRS evaluation of the Site because an HRS site score is based on current conditions . Here, the Site warrants placement on the NPL as evidenced by the Site 
achieving an HRS site score above the listing threshold based on an assessment of the current conditions.  
19 TAI pointed to Attachment A of its comment submissi on, which includes a timeline of related RI/FS work.  
20 TAI quoted Carus Chem. Co. v. EPA , 395 F.3d 434, 437 (D.C. Cir. 2005) to support the nature of  an NPL designation only 
ensuring additional study.  
21 TAI quoted Wash. State Dep’t of Transp. v. EPA , 917 F.2d 1309, 1310 (D.C. Cir.1990) to support that the listing stage of 
the CERCLA process is a tool for identifying sites warranting further study.  
22 TAI pointed to Attachments B And C of its comment submission, which include copies of the EPA and TAI’s 
presentations to the EWCOG.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 34   
With regard  to completed remedial work, completed removal  actions have been  considered in the assessment of 
the Site.  Although response actions may have been completed and other investigations are ongoing, the Site is still 
eligible for NPL placement, and the conditions at the Site qualify for listing as established by the Site achieving an HRS site score of 51.15. The RI/FS referenced by the commenters is ongoing per a settlement agreement. This 
settlement  agreement covers the RI/FS but does not provide  for a potential  site-wide cleanup. However, 
completed response actions and the results of ongoing investigations, including the results of the RI/FS, will be considered in subsequent stages of the CERCLA  process.  
 
Additionally, numerous completed and ongoing investigations were acknowledged in the HRS documentation 
record at proposal. Pages 14-16 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed investigations into the 
Upper Columbia River and associated soil contamination in the Northport area. Page 16 of the HRS 
documentation record at proposal discussed 
that “ numerous EPA Removal activities have occurred in the 
Northport, Washington area, including several removal site evaluations (RSEs).”   
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.15 Risk to Human Health and  the Environment 
Comment: TAI, Stevens County, and several citizens submitted comments questioning whether the Site poses a 
risk. Stevens County and eight citizens commented that the available studies do not appear to indicate a risk posed 
by the Site. Stevens County commented that except for bacteria, which have not been tested for, the Columbia 
River meets water quality standards. One citizen commented that tests to determine whether there is a risk posed 
by metal contamination have not been completed.  
 
In discussing the risks associated with the Columbia River, nine citizens commented that the water is clean and/or 
meets water quality standards. Three  citizens stated that there are no human health risks associated with the Upper 
Columbia River , the Site  and/or Lake Roosevelt. Eight citizens commented that fish are safe to consume. One 
commenter asserted the area is clean except for rubbish.  
 TAI asserted that there has been a miscommunication whether a human health risk is present associated with the 
Upper Columbia River. TAI asserted that the Columbia River does not pose a risk based on past reports. TAI 
commented that an HHRA has been completed, showing no human health risks. TAI also noted a draft BERA has 
been submitted for the aquatic portion of the Site and is a comprehensive assessment of aquatic ecological risk.  
TAI stated that the HRS documentation record at proposal focuses on metal c ontamination in sediments which 
has been determined to not pose a risk to human health. Regarding the risk posed by the Upper Columbia River, TAI commented that the river is safe, asserting that:  
 
• The water in the Columbia River is safe.  
• The beaches are safe, except for one closed beach.  
• The fish from the Columbia River are safe to consume except for largescale suckers.  
• The river has a healthy game fishery. 
• The aquatic portion of the Site does not pose actionable human health risks. 
• Risk calculations completed in the HHRA determined that contaminants of concern were not associated 
with surface water exposure pathways. 
 Commenting on the risk associated with contaminated soil, TAI asserted that, while public communications have 
conveyed that the Upper Columbia River is safe, the EPA has emphasized a possible human health risk associated 
with contaminated soil in the Northport area. TAI commented that a March 5, 2024, EPA news release refers to Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 35  soil contamination as the main risk posed by the Site and pointed to the news releases’ discussion23 of residential 
areas above the EPA’s new screening level. TAI stated that a human health risk associated with lead in residential 
soil has been emphasized and stated that “the potential justification for Listing —if there even is one—is primarily 
due to re sidential properties in and around Northport” as opposed to contamination in the Columbia River. 
Regarding soil contamination, TAI commented that:   
• The majority of properties with soil contamination above the action level have been cleaned up.  
• The RI and ecological risk assessment for the upland soil contamination is ongoing and close to completion.  
• A significant amount of work has been completed.  
• The residential soil contamination has been overstated by including non- residential areas in the scope.  
• Soil contamination affecting numerous residential properties as a result of the former Le Roi/Northport smelter operations is being addressed via removal and remedial actions.  
• Impacted upland soil contamination has been addressed to the current a ction level.  
• The potential human health risk is associated with lead in soil in a small portion of the uplands area adjacent to the former Le Roi smelter.  
• The impacts of air emissions and dusts from the Le Roi smelter have not been fully assessed and 
delineated. 
 In commenting on the risk posed by the Site based on testing of blood levels, Stevens County and EWCOG 
commented that local blood testing does not indicate a health concern. Stevens County commented that local 
studies do not indicate elevated blood levels in children, which were considered the most vulnerable group under the prior EPA guidance. Stevens County asserted that: 
 
• “[I]t draws the conclusion that lead levels of blood in the children and population in the area should be done prior to scoring being completed to show there is an issue.” 
• “Scoring should be done on known risks.”  
 
Additionally, two citizens asserted that data from blood lead level testing on children do not support NPL designation.  
 
In discussing the HRS scoring, TAI commented that the technical reasoning for the proposed listing is 
inconsistent with past EPA communication regarding the risk posed by the Site. [31] Stevens County stated that 
“[i]t is hard to know why the scores are so high to warrant listing with no human health risk and data backing up this conclusion.”  
 
Response : The EPA considers that there is a potential threat to human health and the environment posed by the 
contamination in the surface water sediments and soil and that this threat warrants further investigation  and 
potential further response actions . Consistent with CERCLA, this Site is being placed on the NPL based on an 
HRS evaluation of the risk relative to other sites being considered for the NPL resulting from the release of 
hazardous substances to the Upper Columbia River and exposure to contaminated  soil in residential yards.  
 
 
23 The news release is available at https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa -proposes -adding- upper -columbia -river -wa-
superfund- list. TAI pointed to the following statement in the EPA’s news release, “[t]he agency has determined that soils 
contaminated with lead and arsenic pose unacceptable risk to residents at affected properties, particularly to children. EPA 
determined that soil in  at least 194 residential areas contain lead at levels that exceed the agency’s new screening level for 
residential lead contamination.”  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 36  The EPA has not assumed site- specific risks are present at this Site in determining that the Site qualifies for 
placement on the NPL. The Site achieved an HRS site score above 28.50, which demonstrates that the Site poses 
a sufficient relative risk to warr ant further investigation. The HRS is not a site -specific risk assessment; rather, it 
is a screening tool used to help the EPA determine priorities for cleanup, and possible response activities, and 
represents relative risk among sites undergoing HRS evaluation. Actual determinations of site -specific risk that is 
posed to human health or the environment are determined during a different stage of the CERCLA process.  
 
The NPL is intended primarily to guide the EPA in determining which sites warrant further investigation, 
potential further response action, and to  assess the nature and extent of public health and environmental risks 
associated with a release of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. See 89 FR 16498 (Proposed Rule, 
Upper Columbia River, March 7, 2024); see also 55 FR 51532 (Final Rule, H azard Ranking System, December 
14, 1990) and 82 FR 2760 (Addition of Subsurface Intrusion Component to the Hazard Ranking System, January 
9, 2017). CERCLA § 105(a)(8)(a) requires the EPA to determine NPL priorities among sites based on the 
“relative risk o r danger to public health or welfare, or the environment.” The criteria the EPA applies to determine 
this relative risk or danger is codified in the HRS, and is the Agency’s primary tool for deriving a site score based on the factors identified in CERCLA. The HRS evaluation and score above 28.50 represents the EPA’s 
determination that the Site may pose a relative risk or threat to human health and the environment and warrants 
further investigation under CERCLA. As part of the standard CERCLA  process, once t he Site is on the NPL, the 
investigations performed to date to characterize the Site will be evaluated for completeness, further information will be collected if deemed necessary to adequately characterize the risks posed by the Site, and based on this 
information, a risk assessment decision will be made determining what, if any, remedial action is necessary to 
protect human health and the environment.  
 
Regarding comments asserting that there is either no risk or limited risk posed by exposure to soil at the Site, as 
noted above the specific risk posed by soil contamination at the site is not determined by an HRS evaluation. 
While risk is typically determined during a later stage of the CERCLA  process , as part of the ongoing RI/FS, 
some risk assessment s for portions of the Site  have been completed or started. The full extent of the risk posed by 
the Site has not been determined , and the potential risk pose d by the Site  will continue to be evaluated as part of 
subsequent stages of the CERCLA process.  Regardless, the HRS evaluation of the Site documented lead and 
arsenic contamination in soil that met observed contamination criteria sufficient for HRS scoring purposes. Additionally, multiple hazardous substances have been documented in surface water se diments to meet HRS 
requirements for observed release (antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc), and 
slag containing hazardous subs tances is documented to have been released directly into the Columbia River. 
These hazardous substances present in surface water sediments and in soil are in part attributable to the Site as 
listed at proposal.  
 
In 2021, the  EPA completed the  HHRA at the Site and concluded that risks associated with human exposure to 
contaminated soils exceeds risk -based benchmarks on residential and common use properties. The  EPA’s HHRA 
concluded that human ingestion of certain fish species, including large -scale suckers, exceed ed risk-based 
benchmarks. (See pages 39 and 40 of the HHRA included as Reference 17 of the HRS documentation record at 
proposal.)  
 Regarding comments discussing the risk the Site may pose based on the testing of blood lead levels from local 
populations, blood lead levels are not required for HRS scoring and not used in an HRS evaluation of a site. 
Sufficient relative risk was established by the Site achieving an NPL eligible HRS site score of 51.15 based on the 
HRS scoring of the surface water migration pathway and the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and 
subsurface intrusion pathway.  
 
See also section 3.14, Ongoing Investigation and Remediation,  of this support document for information related to 
investigation and remedial efforts at the Site, and section 3.2, Community Involvement, of this support document 
for discussion of comments about public communications.  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 37  This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.16 Regulatory Limits and Screening Levels 
Comment : Several commenters provided comments discussing contamination compared to screening levels and 
regulatory limits.  
 
Water Quality Several commenters stated there were little to no surface water concentrations that exceeded water quality 
standards in the Upper Columbia River. TAI commented that the Upper Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt 
surface water data indicated few metals have been detected at concentrations exceeding generic water quality benchmarks and standards. Stevens County stated  that the water in Upper Columbia River  and Lake Roosevelt 
meets and exceeds drinking water standards, which makes it hard to understand “ why the s cores are so high to 
warrant listing with no human health risk and data backing up this conclusion.” SCBID commented that comprehensive surface water sampling in the Upper Columbia River, including where irrigation water is drawn 
from the river , has yielded results that were all below human health and ecological surface water screening levels. 
Several  citizens commented that the water in Lake Roosevelt meets drinking water standards and with some 
characterizing the situation as “hardly an environmental cata strophe ”; the same commenters  recognized there is 
metals contamination in sediment s, but described it as trapped or buried in river sediments. One additional public 
commenter stated that tests show most of the lake water meets drinking water standards and most fish are edible with no adverse health issues being reported by those who eat the fish.  
 One citizen  commented that  while the EPA indicated that there are locations with slag that can lower water 
quality levels, most people do not use river water for drinking water.  Soil 
TAI commented  that many residential properties that exceed ed the EPA assigned site- specific action l evel of 700 
parts per million (ppm) lead in soil ha ve already been cleaned up. It commented that it is unclear if scoring the 
upland areas alone would be sufficient to support adding this site to the NPL because these residential properties that exceed the site-specific action level have been cleaned up and the area is sparsely populated. Stevens County commented that all residential properties exceeding prev ious guidance on lead levels have been cleaned up, noting 
that lead levels alone do not indicate a need for remedial actions.  
 
Multiple commenters questioned the use and validity of new EPA lead level guidance. TAI asserted  that the 
existence of areas with lead concentrations above the EPA’s new screening levels  is not an appropriate basis for 
adding a site to the NPL. TAI also commented that an action l evel has already been set, a ction has been taken, and 
the RI/FS is currently underway to determine the type and necessity of remedial actions. TAI contended that the 
EPA’s new screening level does not justify listing, as there is no indication that the current action level for the Site is not protective. Stevens County argued that the EPA’s new soil lead screening level guidance is associated 
with questions regarding its validity and there is no science-based connection to blood levels in vulnerable 
populations. Stevens County also commented that blood studies conducted by the local health district show no 
elevated lead levels in children, prior to the new EPA lead guidance. Stevens County noted that the new EPA lead 
guidance, which is not complete yet, will not match the metal levels regulated by the state of Washington. A citizen also claimed that “ EPA changed the levels downward to match the data” because lead levels in the Stevens 
County area were not high enough to support the listing decision.   
Response: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly documented an observed release of metals, 
including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead zinc, and mercury, to the Upper Columba River based on sediment samples and established the presence of lead and arsenic in soil at concentrations meeting 
observed contamination criteria. That releases to the Upper Columbia River and contamination in the soil may be 
below various site, State, or EPA cleanup standards and goals does not eliminate those hazardous substances or Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 38  their releases from consideration when evaluating a site using the HRS.  CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(B) directs the 
EPA to list on the NPL “releases” of hazardous substances, pollutants and contaminants according to specific 
criteria set out in CERCLA Section 105(a)(8)(A). The definition of “release” in CERCLA Section 101(22) 
exem pts certain releases from its scope, but it does not exempt releases below regulatory limits (or 
screening/action levels).  
 
The concentrations of hazardous substances evaluated in the HRS documentation record at proposal were eligible 
for consideration consistent with the HRS. On July 16, 1982, when responding to public comments on the 
proposed (original) HRS (47 FR 31188), and again on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40665), the EPA rejected the 
idea that releases within regulatory limits should not be considered “observed releases” under the HRS. As the 
EPA noted in 1982:  
 
[E]mission or effluent limits do not necessarily represent levels which cause no harm to public 
health or the environment. These limitations are frequently established on the basis of economic 
impacts or achievability.  
 
By contrast, an observed release represents a 100 percent likelihood that substances can migrate from the site (47 FR 31188, July 16, 1982). Similarly, observed contamination (the soil exposure counterpart for the HRS observed 
release used in other HRS pat hways) documents that a hazardous substance is present in the surface at 
concentrations significantly above background.  
 Section 2.3 of the revised HRS (55 FR 51589, December 14, 1990) states that an observed release can be 
established either by direct observation or by chemical analysis. An observed release by chemical analysis has 
occurred when a contaminant is measured si gnificantly above background level if some portion of the release is 
attributable to the site; observed contamination is documented when a hazardous substance attributable to the site 
is present at a concentration significantly above background levels for the site within two feet of the surface. 
Although contaminant levels may be lower than regulatory limits, an observed release or observed contamination 
is nevertheless considered to have occurred if the measured levels are significantly higher than backgro und levels. 
The HRS does, however, consider whether releases are above regulatory limits in evaluating target populations, increasing by a factor of 10 the weight assigned populations exposed to contaminants above regulatory limits.  For 
this Site, observed releases by both direct observation and chemical analysis were established for the surface 
water migration pathway at the Site (see pages 55 -76 of the HRS documentation record at proposal). The 
observed release by chemical analysis at this Site was established based on sediment samples collected from the 
river. An area of observed contamination was established, as well as Level I targets , for the soil exposure 
component  of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway (see pages 92 -95 and 108 of the HRS 
documentation record at proposal).  
 
Documentation of an observed release or observed exposure and associated HRS likelihood of release/likelihood 
of exposure factors alone  are not intended to reflect the hazard presented by the particular release. Instead, the 
hazard of a site is approximated by the total HRS score, which incorporates the likelihood of release/likelihood of exposure factors  with other factors such as waste characteristics (including waste quantity, toxicity, ecotoxicity, 
persistence, and bioaccumulation) and targets. This tot al HRS score reflects the hazard of the site relative to the 
other sites that have been scored. A more comprehensive characterization of the contamination, associated releases, and the impacts thereof are fully determined during the RI that typically follo ws listing.   
 Regarding the commenters’ claim that many residential properties that exceed the EPA assigned site- specific 
action level have already been cleaned up, the Site has been appropriately evaluated with respect to the response 
actions  and current conditions. The EPA consider s current conditions, including changes in site conditions due to 
all removal and remedial activities, when it considers what CERCLA action, if any, is warranted at a site on the 
NPL. For example, page 92 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 39  [h]owever, since EPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area 
dating back to 2003 [see Site Summary  section of this HRS documentation record], not all 
properties were included within the AOC polygon; for the purpose of determining the hazardous waste quantity area and resident population for the AOC, a conservative approach was taken and only contaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did not have soil 
removals, were included in the calculation . [emphasis  added]  
 
Related to the comments on the use and validity of the EPA’s new lead level guidance, this lead level guidance is 
not relevant to HRS scoring or NPL listing; see section 3.13, Consistency with Guidance/Use of Guidance, of this support document for more det ails. Additionally, blood lead levels are not required for HRS scoring and are not 
used in an HRS evaluation of a site.   
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.17 Other Non-Listing Activities  
Comment : Several commenters submitted comments discussing activities that are not directly related to placing 
the Site on the NPL. 
 
The EWCOG, SCBID, and EBID expressed concern that the proposed NPL placement of the Site could possibly 
impact the on -going Columbia River Treaty negotiations between the U.S. Government and the Government of 
Canada.   
Stevens County commented that it disagreed with Governor Jay Inslee’s letter of concurrence for the NPL listing of the Site. It asserted that local officials were not consulted or contacted prior to the Governor submitting a letter 
of concurrence. Stevens County requested that the Governor retract the letter of concurrence. Stevens County also 
requested that the Governor discuss the NPL listing with local officials before supporting NPL designation of the 
Site.  
 
Two citizens submitted comments discussing  the dam (Grand Coulee Dam) . One commenter opposed listing 
pointing to the need for the nearby dams for hydroelectric power and for agricultural irrigation purposes and noting that the dams have fish passages. A second citizen submitted similar comments, noting the value of the 
dam for hydroelectric power and irrigation; the commenter stated that if fish are the concern, mitigation of fish 
migration pathways should occur via a fish ladder or other alternatives as opposed to removal of the dam.   
Response: Comments presenting  concerns regarding the on -going Columbia River Treaty negotiations, the 
coordination efforts between the Governor and local officials , and impacts to the Grand Coulee Dam  have been 
noted and are in the public record for the Site. These topics fall outside of the scope of the present listing action; therefore, these comments do not impact the HRS site score or the decision to list the Site on the NPL.  
 
Regarding the Columbia River Treaty negotiations discussed by commenters, these negotiations are handled by 
the State Department and are outside the scope of the listing decision. The State Department is involved with 
these negotiations and provides additional information for interested individuals on its Columbia River Treaty 
webpage ( https://www.state.gov/columbia- river -treaty/ ). 
 Regarding Stevens County’s concerns about the Governor’s concurrence letter  and coordination with local 
officials , the Governor of the s tate of Washington supported NPL designation in his letter expressing concurrence 
with the EPA’s decision to list the Site on the NPL. The letter of concurrence, in part, states “ [o]n behalf of the 
state of Washington, I strongly support the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed listing of the 
Upper Columbia River (UCR) Site on the National Priorities List (NPL).” Additionally, Stevens County’s Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 40  concerns regarding coordination efforts between the Governor and local officials are outside the scope of the 
present NPL listing action.  
 Additionally, the NPL designation of the Site does not determine the fate of the dam  (the Grand Co ulee Dam ). 
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.18 Non-Scoring HRS Documentation Record Comments 
Comment : TAI and the Government of Canada provided comments discussing possible inconsistencies in the 
HRS documentation record at proposal relating to discussion of slag releases and/or the discussion of a fish advisory study.  
 
Regarding slag releases, the Government of Canada requested that revisions be made in the HRS documentation 
record at proposal to clarify that these are historical releases that occurred only up through 1996, with the 
exception of three  accidental releases in 1998. The Government of Canada stated that slag has not been 
discharged from the Cominco  smelter since 1998 and requested that the discussion clarify that current effluent 
does not contain slag. The Government of Canada also requested additional revisions related to slag releases, 
suggesting changes to the following discussions in  the HRS documentation record at proposal: 
 
• The discussion on page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal referring to Cominco’s 
operations as characterized by frequent accidental releases into the river should be clarified as historical.  
• The discussion on page 55 of the HRS documentation record at proposal noting that, “[t]he BC MOE 
required the elimination of slag to the Columbia River by December 1996; however; since this time, 
Cominco has had several releases of slag to the river” should be clarified as historical.  
• The discussion on pages 53 and 55 of the HRS documentation record at proposal described probable point 
of entry ( PPE) 1, associated with the Trail facility, in present tense and PPE2, associated with the Le Roi 
smelter, in past tense, even though the Trail facility halted slag releases to the river in 1996 and thus this 
should be corrected. 
• The discussion on page 77 of the HRS documentation record at proposal that refers to “outfalls that 
discharge effluent and slag” to the river should be clarified as historical.  
• The description of the table on page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal should be revised to 
“‘Table 1 lists hazardous substances present in Cominco outfall effluent in 199[5/6].’” 
 
Regarding the discussion of a Washington State Department of Health (WSDH)  fish advisory (Reference 52 of 
the HRS documentation record at proposal), TAI and the Government of Canada commented that the discussion of the fish advisory on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal appear ed to incorrectly discuss the 
advisory. TAI asserted that the HRS documentation record at proposal misidentified the origin of a statement identifying Teck as the source of metals in the river in stating “ ‘[a] [Washing ton State Department of Health 
(WSDH)]  fish consumption advisory Technical Summary (dated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a 
primary source of metals and other chemical contaminants in the UCR’ ”; instead of the Washington State 
Department of Health, TAI commented that the origin is actually identified in the advisory document as the EPA. 
The Government of Canada questioned the same statement, noting that it appear ed to suggest that Teck is a source 
of fish advisories associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)  and mercury even though smelters and 
atmospheric sources are identified in the report. The Government of Canada noted that the report refers to Teck because the WS DH used data related to Teck from a fish study. The Government of Canada requested that the 
statement on page 84 be revised to clarify the reason for the advisory.   Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 41  Response:  The commenters’ points about possible inconsistencies in the HRS documentation record at proposal 
have been noted and are included as a part of the record for the Site because they were submitted to the docket as 
comments. While the EPA acknowledges the po ints provided by the commenters, the EPA notes that these 
possible inconsistencies do not affect the HRS site score or impact the decision to add the Site to the NPL.  
 
The commenter is correct that the supporting information indicates that slag discharges from Teck were historical, 
and the EPA does  not dispute these as historical  discharges; this is evidenced by the below items from the HRS 
documentation record at proposal . Page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal state d, “[s] lag, 
historically  discharged via smelter outfalls to the Columbia River….” [emphasis added] Further, page 31 stated 
“[t]he B.C. Ministry of Environment, Lands, and Parks required the elimination of slag to the Columbia River by 
December 1996; however, since this time, Cominco has had several releases of slag to the river during upset 
conditions.” Page 55 stated “Cominco operated four outfalls that have historically  discharged slag and effluent 
directly to the Columbia River .” [emphasis added] The statement regarding frequent accidental releases on HRS 
documentation record at proposal page 31 was intended to describe a wider array of spills (only some of which 
include slag), as further detailed on HRS documentation record at proposal pages 55-57. Page 55 provided a 
timeline for the releases and specifically stated that not all of the releases involved hazardous substances:  
 
Cominco’s operations have been characterized by frequent accidental releases of contaminants into the UCR. On 86 occasions between September 1987 and May 2001, Cominco reported 
spills of pollutants into the UCR; although not all would necessarily involve hazardous 
substances …. [emphasis added] 
 
Table 8 of the HRS documentation record list ed historical spills, only some of which mention slag.  
 All of  this information indicates that the HRS documentation record at proposal recognized the releases of slag 
from Cominco were , for the most part , historical.  
 The discussion of PPE1 on page 53 of the HRS documentation record at proposal began  by stating “ Cominco 
operates outfalls that have historically discharged slag and effluent directly to the UCR” [emphasis added] and 
subsequent discussion of PPE1 in the present tense generally involves HRS scoring elements (the HRS probable 
point of entry itself, the HRS in- water segment, the HRS target distance limit). PPEs can be historical in nature, 
and t here are no HRS requirements that PPEs or releases have to be occur ring in the present day to be eligible for 
HRS listing.  
 
Regarding the paragraph concerning the fish advisory on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal , 
the commenter is correct that Teck is not the sole cause of the fish advisory , and the intent of the HRS 
documentation record was not to imply that Teck was the sole cause. T he intent of the associated statements in the 
HRS documentation record at proposal was simply to note that 1) fish advisories are in place that affect the Upper 
Columbia River, 2) the advisories are due to both PCBs ( which is not  associated with the Site) and mercury 
(which is  associated with the Site); and Teck is a significant contributor to contaminants (including contaminants 
in the river).  
 On the origin of identification of the Cominco  smelter as a primary source of metals and other chemical 
contaminants in the Upper Columbia River, the EPA acknowledges that the commenters are correct and clarifies 
that, although the supporting statement is housed in a WSDH document, that document attributes the 
identification to the EPA.  
 
Because these issues do not affect the HRS site score or the decision to list the Site on the NPL, the HRS 
documentation record at proposal itself will not be revised; however , these clarifications are part of the record for 
the Site by virtue of inclusion in this support document.  
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024

3.19 Hazardous Substance Definition 
Comment : TAI commented that slag is not a CERCLA hazardous substance and is not included in 40 CFR part 
302, Table 302.4, List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities. TAI also asserted that the solid waste 
definition in 40 CFR 261.4 excludes slag. TAI stated that the hazardous constituent quantity is based only on the 
mass of CERCLA hazardous substances. TAI asserted that since slag is not a hazardous substance under 
CERLCA, using slag to determine the hazardous waste quantity for Source 1 is incorrect and misleading.  
 
Response: Slag is appropriate to use in determining the hazardous waste quantity for a source in the HRS 
evaluation of a site because it is a source material that contains hazardous substances. Although “slag” is indeed 
not itself a CERCLA hazardous substance, it contains CERCLA hazardous substances eligible for HRS scoring, 
and the hazardous substances within the slag evaluated as part of Source 124 were appropriately associated with 
the source. A material need not be a “solid waste” or “hazardous waste” under the 40 CFR Part 261 list for 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA) to be addressed under CERCLA. 
 HRS Section 1.1, Definitions , defines a hazardous substance for HRS purposes as “CERCLA hazardous 
substances, pollutants, and contaminants as defined in CERCLA Sections 101(14) and 101(33), except where otherwise specifically noted in the HRS.” Additionally:  
• CERCLA Section 101(14) defines “hazardous substance” in the context of other f ederal legislation, 
including substances listed pursuant to Sections 307(a) and 311(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (known as RCRA), and Section 112 of the 
Clean Air Act, and substances that are the subject of an action under Section 7 of the Toxic Substances Control Act. It states that a CERCLA “hazardous substance” is:  
(A) any substance designated pursuant to section 311(b)(2)(A) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A)], (B) any element, compound, mixture, 
solution, or substance designated pursuant to section 9602 of this title, (C) any hazardous 
waste having the characteristics identified under or listed pursuant to section 3001 of the 
Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6921] (but not including any waste the regulation of which under the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.] has been suspended 
by Act of Congress), (D) any toxic pollutant listed under section 307(a) of the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1317(a)], (E) any hazardous air pollutant listed 
under section 112 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7412], and (F) a ny imminently 
hazardous chemical substance or mixture with respect to which the Administrator has 
taken action pursuant to section 7 of the Toxic Substances Control Act [15 U.S.C. 2606]. 
The term does not include petroleum, including crude oil or any fract ion thereof which is 
not otherwise specifically listed or designated as a hazardous substance under subparagraphs (A) through (F) of this paragraph, and the term does not include natural 
gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usa ble for fuel (or mixtures 
of natural gas and such synthetic gas).”  
Thus, hazardous wastes as defined under RCRA are only a subset of the broader list of CERCLA 
hazardous substances.  
 
24 Page 31 of the HRS documentation record at proposal referred  to the name of Source 1 as “Cominco Outfalls Slag”; 
however, for HRS scoring purposes, Source 1 does not solely consist of slag and is defined as “effluent from outfalls from a 
lead, silver, and zinc smelter and fertilizer production operation owned by Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada, Ltd.  (Cominco). ” Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 43  • CERCLA Section 102(a) empowers the Administrator to promulgate regulations designating other 
substances as hazardous if when released into the environment they may present substantial danger to the 
public health or welfare or the environment. 
• CERCLA Section 101(33) defines “pollutant or contaminant” as including but not limited to “any 
element, substance, compound, or mixture, including disease -causing agents, which after release into the 
environment and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation, or assimilation into any organism, either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through food chains, will or may reasonably be 
anticipated to cause death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutation, physiological 
malfunctions (including malfunctions in reproduction) or physical deformations, in such organisms or 
their offspring.” Substances meeting that definition may also be addressed under CERCLA. 
 
The list of hazardous substances for CERCLA purposes (pursuant to CERCLA Section 102) is maintained in table 
302.4 of 40 CFR part 302.4.
25 This table also notes the particular federal legislation under which each hazardous 
substance is designated.  
 
HRS Section 2.2.2, Identify hazardous substances associated with a source , gives instruction on associating 
hazardous substances with a source, stating:  
 
For each of the three migration pathways, consider those hazardous substances documented in a source (for example, by sampling, labels, manifests, oral or written statements) to be associated 
with that source when evaluating each pathway. 
 Page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal explained  that hazardous substances are associated with 
Source 1, Cominco Outfalls Slag. Page 33 stated that: 
 
[E]ffluent was not sampled by consultants for EPA. For this reason, hazardous substances listed 
to be present in outfall effluent are documented by Cominco reports and from outfall releases reported to the B.C. Ministry of Environment, Lands, and Parks by Com inco.

Thus a ntimony, arsenic, cadmium , chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc were 
associated with Source 1. These substances are CERCLA hazardous substances based on their specific 
listing in the list of CERCLA hazardous substances. The 40 CFR Table 302.4 list of CERCLA hazardous substances includes antimony, arsenic, cadmium , chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and 
zinc, and shows that each of these particular substances qualifies  as a CERCLA hazardous substance via 
being listed as a t oxic pollutant under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and/or a hazardous air 
pollutant under the Clean Air Act (i.e., via CERCLA 101(14) subparts (D) and (E), respectively). These substances therefore qualify as CERCLA hazardous substances, meet the HRS definition of hazardous substance, and are eligible for HRS scoring. 
 
In addition, the fact that slag 
 as a material does not qualify as a RCRA hazardous waste does not negate 
the CERCLA hazardous substance status of the metals in that slag. As noted above, the CERCLA 
definition of hazardous substances includes those substances listed as RCRA hazardous was tes as a subset  
of substances that qualify as CERCLA hazardous substances, along with substances listed under the other statutes. Exclusion of a material under one of these statutes does not invalidate the inclusion of the same or related material on one of the other statute’s lists. The courts have understood that RCRA hazardous 
wastes are only one subset of the broader list of CERCLA hazardous substances. See, e.g., Louisiana-
Pacific Corp. v. ASARCO, Inc., 24 F.3d 1565, 1572-1573 (9th Cir. 1994); Eagle-Picher v. EPA, 759 F.2d 
922, 926-931 (D.C. Cir. 1985).
26 Thus, the metals in the slag were properly scored based on their 
eligibility as CERCLA hazardous substances consistent with the HRS definition of a hazardous 
substance. 
 
Finally, as further explained in section 3.20, Source 1 Hazardous Waste Quantity, of this support 
do
cument, the hazardous constituent quantity was not scored for Source 1. The hazardous wastestream 
quantity was used to determine the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity value and involves a measure of 
the mass of source material  that contains CERCLA hazardous substances. 
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.20 Source 1 Hazardous Waste Quantity  
Comment : TAI commented that the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity was not appropriately estimated. TAI 
stated that the HRS documentation record at proposal incorrectly used a release of 4,313,132 cubic yards of slag 
to assign a maximum hazardous waste quantity value from HRS Table 2- 6. TAI commented that the HRS uses the 
 
26 The Eagle Picher  court opinion included that “based upon the clear language of section 101(14), we conclude that the 
exception set forth in section 101(14)(C) does not prevent a substance from being labelled a ‘ hazardous substance ’ if it falls 
within another subparagraph of section 101(14).”  Eagle -Picher v. EPA , 759 F.2d 922, 930  (D.C. Cir. 1985).  The Louisiana -
Pacific Corp. opinion discussed that slag in that case included metals like arsenic, copper, lead, and zinc and that these are 
hazardous substances under CERCLA 101(14) subsections (A), (B), and (D), and noted that “[t] he fact that slag is excepted 
from subsection (C) by the Bevill Amendment has no bearing on whether slag in its component forms is excepted from the 
other subsections. ” Louisiana- Pacific Corp. v. ASARCO, Inc., 24 F.3d 1565, 1572- 1573 (9th Cir. 1994) . Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 45  mass of CERCLA hazardous substances to determine the hazardous constituent quantity. TAI also stated that slag 
is not a CERCLA hazardous substance and excluded from the definition of solid waste under 40 CFR 261.4. TAI 
concluded that the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity value was incorrectly estimated based on a volume of slag, 
which is not a CERCLA hazardous substance.  
 
Response: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly assigned a hazardous waste quantity value for 
Source 1 based on an evaluation of Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity. The HRS documentation record at proposal did not evaluate Tier A, hazardous constituent quantity, for Source 1 as implied by the commenter. 
 
H
RS Section 1.1, Definitions , defines a hazardous wastestream as “[m] aterial containing  CERCLA hazardous 
substances (as defined in CERCLA section 101[14]) that was deposited, stored, disposed, or placed in, or that otherwise migrated to, a source .” 
 In providing instructions for the source hazardous waste quantity evaluation, HRS Section 2.4.2.1.2, Hazardous 
wastestream quantity , states:  
 
Evaluate hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure) based on the mass of hazardous wastestreams plus the mass of any 
additional C ERCLA pollutants and contaminants (as defined in CERCLA section 101[33], as 
amended) that are allocated to the source (or area of observed contamination or area of observed exposure). For a wastestream that consists solely of a hazardous waste listed pursuant to section 3001 of RCRA, as amended or that consists solely of a RC RA hazardous waste that exhibits the 
characteristics identified under section 3001 of RC RA, as amended, include the mass of that 
entire hazardous waste in the evaluation of this measure.   
Based on this mass, designated as W, assign a value for hazardous wastestream quantity as 
follows: 
• For the migration pathways, assign the source a value for hazardous wastestream quantity using the Tier B equation of Table 2–5…. 
Do not evaluate the volume and area measures described below if the source is the unallocated source or if the following condition applies: 
• The hazardous wastestream quantity for the source (or area of observed contamination or 
area of observed exposure) is adequately determined–that is, total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from 
the source (or for the area of observed contamination) is known or is estimated with 
reasonable confidence…. 
Otherwise, assign the source (or area of observed contamination) a value for hazardous 
wastestream quantity based on the available data and proceed to section 2.4.2.1.3. 
 
HRS Section 2.4.2.1.5, Calculation of source hazardous waste quantity value , states:  
 
Select the highest of the values assigned to the source (or areas of observed contamination, areas 
of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface contamination) for the hazardous constituent 
quantity, hazardous wastestream quantity, volume, and area measures. 
 Page 33 of the HRS documentation record at proposal identified the hazardous substances associated with Source 1. As explained in section 3.19, Hazardous Substance Definition, of this support document, page 33 of the HRS 
documentation record at proposal include d Tables 1 and 2 , which identify that a ntimony, arsenic, cadmium , 
chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc were associated with Source 1.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 46  As part of the discussion of the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity evaluation, page 34 of the HRS documentation 
record at proposal stated that:  
 
Therefore, there is insufficient information to evaluate the associated releases from the source to calculate the hazardous constituent quantity for Source 1 with reasonable confidence. As a result, 
the evaluation of hazardous waste quantity proceeds to the evaluation of Tier B , Hazardous 
Wastestream Quantity . 
 
In discussing the scoring of Tier B, Hazardous Wastestream Quantity, pages 34 and 38 state d: 
 
Reports that accurately document the yearly and daily amounts of tail slag released to the UCR from the Cominco smelter have not been located. Reports prepared by consultants to Cominco 
state that prior to 1995, slag was discharged to the UCR at an average yearly rate of 145,000 
tonnes or 159,836 tons (i.e., 145,000 tonnes / 0.90718 tonnes per 1 ton = 159,836 tons) and an 
average daily rate of 360 tonnes or 397 tons (i.e., 360 tonnes / 0.90718 tonnes per 1 ton = 397 
tons) [Ref. 13, p. 37; Ref. 53, p. 2]. The quantity of slag produced for each year of smelter operation can more accurately be calculated from lead production values. Cominco has reported 
that the amount of lead is directly related to the amount of slag produced using the following 
information [R ef. 15, p. 2].  
 
Lead production x 140% = amount of blast furnace slag produced.  Amount of blast furnace slag produced x 85% = Amount of slag produced. For example:  
 
- 151,492 tons of lead produced in 1930 x 140% = 212,088.8 tons of blast furnace slag 
- 212,088.8 tons of blast furnace slag x 85% = 180,275.48 tons of slag produced in 1930 
 
Lead production values were obtained from Cominco annual reports [Ref. 3, pp. 3- 20]. Using this 
information, it is estimated that 11,980,922.52 tons or 23,961,845,040 pounds (11,980,922.52 x 2,000 pounds per 1 ton) of tail slag were produced from the Cominco smelter and released to the 
UCR over the course of operations from 1930 to 1994 as demonstrated in Table 3 below…  
Based on the report conducted by a consultant for CCT, it is estimated that 90 percent of the slag discharged to the UCR (between 1930 and 1994) was transported into the U.S. [Ref. 18, p. 5, 87, 
89, 90]. The value assigned to hazardous wastestream quantity is calculated as follows:  
 
23,961,845,040 pounds x 0.9 = 21,565,660,536 pounds  21,565,660,536 pounds / 5,000 = 4,313,132.10  
Hazardous Wastestream Quantity (W) Value: 4,313,132.10  
[Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.1.2, Table 2-5] 
 Page 39 of the HRS documentation record at proposal discussed the source hazardous waste quantity value for 
Source 1 and stated , “[t] he source hazardous waste quantity value for Source 1 is 4,313,132.10 for Tier B – 
Hazardous Wastestream Quantity .” 
 In calculating the hazardous waste quantity for Source 1, the hazardous wastestream quantity was evaluated and 
not the hazardous constituent quantity as implied by the commenter. Page 34 of the HRS documentation record at 
proposal, quoted above, explained  that because insufficient information was available to calculate Tier A, 
hazardous constituent quantity, the next tier, Tier B, hazardous wastestream quantity , was evaluated instead.  
 
As described in HRS Section 2.4.2.1.1, Hazardous constituent quantity , t
 he hazardous constituent quantity is the 
HRS measure that involves just the mass of hazardous substances (i.e., it is “based solely on the mass of CERCLA  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 47  hazardous substances (as defined in CERCLA  section 101(14)” with some exceptions for certain RCRA wastes). 
By contrast, for HRS purposes, a hazardous wastestream  is defined as material that contains hazardous substances, 
and the mass of that wastestream is the subject of this hazardous waste quantity measure. (See HRS Section 
2.4.2.1.2, quoted above.) Slag is material containing hazardous substances that are eligible for HRS scoring, as explained in section 3.19, Hazardous Substance Definition, of this support document. Therefore, slag that has been 
released from an outfall is consistent with the HRS definition of a hazardous wastestream.  
 A
s these comments relate to the evaluation of the hazardous waste quantity, Tier B, the hazardous wastestream 
quantity, was properly determined consistent with the HRS requirements. HRS Section 2.4.2.1.2 directs to 
calculate the mass of hazardous wastestreams and to assign a value for the hazardous wastestream quantity 
regardless of whether it is completely or partially estimated. Using the available data for the mass of slag released (i.e., an HRS- eligible hazardous wastestream), a partial estimate of the mass of the wastestream from the outfall 
(i.e., the slag) was calculated as 21,565,660,536 pounds. In this case, only the slag discharged to the river and transported to the U.S. part of the river was scored. As quoted above, after applying the divisor in HRS Table 2-5, 
a value of 4,313,132.10 was assigned as a partial estimate of the hazardous wastestream quantity. As directed in 
HRS Section 2.4.2.1.2, because the “total mass of all hazardous wastestreams and CERCLA pollutants and contaminants for the source and releases from the source” is not known or “estimated with reasonable confidence,” 
the evaluation proceeded to Tier C, Volume, in accordance with the HRS.  
 Furthermore, although the HRS documentation record at proposal assigned the Source 1 hazardous waste quantity 
value based on a partial Tier B (hazardous wastestream quantity) estimate, the Tier C (volume) estimate received the same value. As discussed on page 38 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, the HRS documentation 
record at proposal also evaluated Tier C, Volume, based on the volume of the slag discharged and carried to the 
U.S. part of the river , which received the same estimated value of 4,313,132.10. 
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL.  
3.21 Surface Water Migration Pathway 
Comment : TAI and three citizens submitted comments questioning aspects of the scoring of the surface water 
migration pathway.  
 
Response: The HRS documentation record at proposal properly scored the surface water migration pathway 
consistent with the HRS. Specific comments and responses are provided below in the following subsections:  
 
• 3.21.1 C
ontainment  
• 3.21.2 Attribution 
• 3.21.3 Waste Characteristics 
• 3.21.4 Human Food Chain Threat – Targets 
 
3.21.1  Containment  
Comment: TAI and three citizens submitted comments related to containment of contamination. TAI asserted that 
metals are releasing from slag at slow rates as indicated by the few metals detected at concentrations above 
benchmarks. Two citizens commented that the metal contamination in the Upper Columbia River is buried 
beneath sediment. A citizen stated that metals are covered by sediment as indicated by the lack of contamination 
in bottom feeding fish.  
 
Response :  Insomuch as these comments pertain to whether the contamination scored is contained, Sources 1, 2, 
and 3 were determined to be uncontained for HRS scoring purposes. F or HRS scoring purposes, the containment Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 48  of contamination is generally measured at the source and is an evaluation of how well contained hazardous 
substance- bearing source material is from escaping into the environment.  
 In providing source containment instructions in the surface water migration pathway section, HRS Section 4.1.2.1.2.1.1, Containment , states:  
 
Determine the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:  
• If one or more sources is located in surface water in the watershed (for example, intact sealed drums in surface water), assign the containment factor a value of 10 for the  
watershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1. 
• If none of the sources is located in surface water in the watershed, assign a containment factor value from table 4 –2 to each source at the site that can potentially release 
hazardous substances to the hazardous substance migration path for this watershed. 
Assign the containment factor value for the watershed as follows:  
- Select the highest containment factor value assigned to those sources that meet the 
minimum size requirement described below. Assign this highest value as the 
containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1. 
- If, for this watershed, no source at the site meets the minimum size requirement, then 
select the highest containment factor value assigned to the sources at the site eligible 
to be evaluated for this watershed and assign it as the containment factor value for the watershed. Enter this value in table 4 –1.  
A source meets the minimum size requirement if its source hazardous waste quantity value (see 
section 2.4.2.1.5) is 0.5 or more. Do not include the minimum size requirement in evaluating any other factor of this surface water migration component, except po tential to release by flood as 
specified in section 4.1.2.1.2.2.3.

In discussing Source 1, page 32 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  
 
Containment 
 Release to surface water via overland migration:  
The source consists of outfalls that discharged effluent and slag directly to the Columbia River 
[Ref. 4, p. 26]. A surface water containment value of 10 is assigned based on evidence of 
hazardous substance migration from the source to the UCR [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. 
 
Release to surface water via flood:  
 The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it 
does not affect the listing decision. 
 
In discussing Source 2, page 40 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated:  
 
Containment 
 Release to surface water via overland migration: The source consists of exposed contaminated 
soil which does not have a maintained engineered cover or a functioning and maintained run-on 
control system and runoff management system [Refs. 5, p. 791-792; 38, pp. 68-69, 94; 57, p. 2]. A surface water containment factor value of 10 is assigned [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. 
 Release to surface water via flood:  
 The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it does not affect the listing decision. 
 In discussing Source 3, pages 46 -47 of the HRS documentation record at proposal stated :  
 
Containment  
 
Release to surface water via overland migration: The source consists of sluice boxes which 
discharged slag directly to the UCR. This source does not have a maintained engineered cover or 
a functioning and maintained run-on control system and runoff management system [Refs. 4, pp. 
22-24; 5, pp. 780-782; 46, pp. 9-10]. During RI activities conducted by a contractor of the 
Washington State Department of Ecology in 2019, slag was observed in 101 of 138 samples 
sampled along the UCR waterfront. Most of the obser ved slag was either granular or mixed Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 50  granular and clinker [Ref. 37, pp. 10, 36-38]. Based on this information and the direct discharge 
to the UCR (evidence of hazardous substance migration from the source to the UCR), a surface 
water containment factor value of 10 is assigned [Ref. 1, Table 4 -2]. 
 
Release to surface water via flood:  
 The containment factor value for release to surface water via flood is not evaluated because it 
does not affect the listing decision. 
 
Source 1 (Cominco outfalls slag), Source 2 (contaminated soil), and Source 3 (Le Roi sluice boxes discharge) 
were assigned containment factor values of 10 because of evidence of hazardous substance migration and/or a 
lack of containment features  as quoted above. As indicated in the HRS, quoted above, hazardous substances 
associated with a source with a surface water containment factor value greater than 0 are considered available to the watershed and included in the Site score because these sourc es are not fully contained. As all three sources 
were assigned containment factor values of 10 based on source-specific conditions, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly established that each source is uncontained and the associated contamination, including the Cominco outfalls slag (Source 1) and the Le Roi sluice boxes discharge (Source 3), is available to 
the watershed and the surface water migration pathway. For source material that has already migrated into a 
pathway medium— i.e., slag in surface water  sediments for the Site— the HRS scoring factors for the surface 
water migration pathway do not consider such characteristics as the rate of hazardous substance leaching from source materials in sediments into the aqueous phase of the water body or sediment cover of the contaminants.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
3.21.2  Attribution  
Comment: TAI submitted comments discussing other possible contributors to the contamination scored. TAI 
asserted that the Other Possible Sources Not Scored section of the HRS documentation record at proposal is 
incomplete because it does not discuss other possible origins of contamination.  
 
Response: The Other Possible Sources Not Scored section of the HRS documentation record wa s intended to 
provide discussion of other possible sources associated  with the site being scored (i.e., releases from Cominco 
smelter and Le Roi smelter) , as opposed to other non- site-related  sources. Insomuch as these comments relate to 
the consideration of other possible non- site-related contributors of contamination (contributors other than the 
releases from Cominco smelter and Le Roi smelter) in determining appropr iate attribution of the releases scored, 
such contributors were discussed in the Attribution section of the HRS documentation record at proposal, and 
attribution of the significant increase of hazardous substances to the Site, at l east in part, was properly 
documented for the purpose of scoring an observed release by chemical analysis to surface water.  
 In presenting the requirements for an observed release by chemical analysis, HRS Section 4.1.2.1.1, Observed 
Release, states, in relevant part:  
 
Establish an observed release to surface water for a watershed by demonstrating that the site has 
released a hazardous substance to the surface water in the watershed. Base this demonstration on 
either:  
• Direct observation .… 
• Chemical analysis:  
- Analysis of surface water, benthi c, or sediment samples indicates that the 
concentration of hazardous substance(s) has increased significantly above the 
background concentration for the site for that type of sample (see section 2.3)…. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 51  • Some portion of the significant increase must be attributable to the site to 
establish the observed release, except: when the site itself consists of contaminated sediments with no identified source, no separate attribution is required. [emphasis 
added] 
 
In describing other possibles sources associated with the Upper Columbia River site (i.e., related to the Cominco 
smelter and Le Roi smelter) that were not scored as sources, page 52 of the HRS documentation record at

Other Possible Sources Not Scored  
 
Cominco Smelter – Fertilizer Outfall Effluent Discharge  - Fertilizer plants were built at the Trail 
smelter in 1930, facilitating the production of both nitrogen- and phosphorous- based fertilizers. 
One of the five outfalls associated with the Cominco smelter (i.e., Sewer IV) was used for the fertilizer operati on, which discharged effluent to the UCR. A trend graph of metals in effluents 
from the metallurgical operation from 1980 to 1996 demonstrates that fertilizer plant operation contributed to an average effluent discharge up to 4 kg/d of total mercury and 350 kg/d of dissolved zinc [Refs. 4, pp. 25, 26; 9, pp. 6, 24; 12, p. 18]. The outfall discharge associated with 
the fertilizer operation was not scored in this HRS documentation record because the current 
surface water m igration pathway score has a maximum pathway score of 100.  
 This section wa s not intended to address non- site sources unrelated to the Cominco smelter and Le Roi smelter. 
Instead , the HRS documentation record at proposal described the rationale used to assess attribution for the 
observed release in the surface water migration pathway on pages 77 -81. Th is Attribution section  include s on

 Analytical results from sediment samples collected in September and October 2019 by 
consultants of Teck as part of a Phase 3 sediment study document an observed release by 
chemical analysis to the UCR. The UCR is contaminated with heavy metals from the U.S . Canada 
border to RM 708 near Marcus, Washington, an approximate 35- mile stretch of river [see Section 
4.1.2.1.1 of this HRS documentation record]. Although sediment samples were collected from three areas of concern which are several miles apart, contami nation does exist between these 
areas. A Phase 2 Sediment study was previously conducted by a consultant of Teck and when this sediment data is combined with the Phase 3 data, the 35 -mile stretch encompassing the zone of 
contamination exhibits nearly conti nuous contamination [Ref. 66, pp. 3-162]. Sources associated 
with each smelter included in this HRS documentation record [see Section 2.2 of this HRS 
documentation record] have contributed to commingling of metals contamination in the UCR [see 
Section 4.1.2.1.1 of this HRS documentation record] and impact the targets on the UCR including 
fisheries, wetlands, and a Federal- designated threatened species habitat [Sections 4.1.3.3.1, 
4.1.3.3.2.2, and 4.1.4.3.1.2 of this HRS documentation record].  
 Previous sediment investigations within the UCR have also documented contamination to the 
UCR from sources associated with both smelters. In 2001, consultants for EPA conducted an 
expanded site inspection (ESI) of the UCR.... Analytical results from this investigation indicated 
widespread contamination in lake and river sediments throughout the UCR between Inchelium, 
Washington and the U.S.- Canada border. Arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, and zinc 
were detected at conc entrations significantly above background sample concentrations, which 
were collected from Lower Arrow Lake by the Washington State Department of Ecology [Ref. 4, pp. 66, 71-85]. During this investigation, several sediment samples collected from the UCR Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 52  consisted of a visibly dark glassy sandy mixture characterized by EPA field personnel as slag 
[Ref. 4, p. 93]. The ESI sampling program also included the collection of sediment samples from 
the mouths of 110 tributaries located along the UCR to determine other potential sources of 
contamination. Analytical results from tributary samples did not indicate the presence of elevated 
contaminants of interest indicative of major watershed sources of contamination [Refs. 4, pp. 
165-217, 226- 227; 17, pp. 62- 63]. 
 Source 1 (i.e., Cominco Outfalls Slag) is located approximately 10 RMs upstream of the U.S.-
Canada border and was scored based on an observed release by direct observation from outfalls 
that discharge effluent  and slag contaminated with metals directly to the UCR [see Source 1 
discussion Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation record]. Although the most upstream scored 
observed release sample is located at Deadman’s Eddy, approximately 17 RMs downstream of 
the Cominco outfalls, contamination of the UCR does exist between the Cominco facility and the 
most upstream scored observed release sample located in Deadman’s Eddy… In 2010, a 
consultant for CCT collected sediment samples from the UCR at locations both upstream and 
downstream of the Cominco outfalls. Analytical results of sediment samples collected during this investigation indicates that concentrations of these metals increased markedly downstream 
(compared to sediment samples collected upstream) of the Cominco smelter and remained at 
elevated levels at four U.S. sampling sites across the U.S. border; the most downstream sample being collected upstream of the Le Roi smelter. Background sediment samples were collected 
upstream of the Cominco smelter in Genelle and just downstream of the Keenleyside Dam [Ref. 
18, pp. 58, 72, 74]. In addition, analytical results of a slag sample collected near the Cominco 
smelter indicated the presence of metals including antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, 
copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and mercury [see Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 
18, pp. 36, 58, 63, 74].  
 
From the Cominco smelter outfalls, metals contamination extends downstream along the UCR 
where it comingles with releases associated with the Le Roi smelter. In 1897, the Le Roi smelter 
began refining copper, lead, and silver ores from mines in northeast W ashington, as well as 
copper ore from British Columbia, Canada [Ref. 5, p, 104] …. The smelter was closed and 
dismantled in 1922, after 24 years of sporadic operation [Ref. 5, p. 105]. During its operation, 
slag was discharged from the furnaces at the Le Ro i smelter directly into the UCR via 
underground waterways, also referred to as sluice boxes (i.e., Source 3) …. Facility maps from 
1901 and 1908 depict five underground waterways (sluice boxes, grouped as three passage areas) 
transporting slag from furnaces to discharge points on the UCR [Refs. 4, p. 24; 46, pp. 9- 10].  
 
In 2019, an RI of the Northport Waterfront was conducted by a consultant of the Washington 
State Department of Ecology …. During this investigation, slag materials, (as both clinker and 
fine granulated particles) were noted to be widespread on the beach, the hillside leading to the UCR as well as in the UCR [Ref. 37, pp. 6, 7, 36- 38]…. 
 
The presence of slag along the shores of the UCR has been documented from Trail B.C., the 
location of the Cominco smelter, to RM 708 in Washington State indicating Cominco and Le Roi 
smelters as the sources for this contamination [see Section 2.2 of this HRS documentation 
record].  
 
Metals associated with Cominco smelter and the Le Roi smelter sources were detected at 
concentrations significantly above those concentrations detected in background sediment 
samples; therefore, at least some portion of the significant increase of these me tals in observed 
release samples in the UCR is attributable to a release from sources associated with both smelters [Table 11; Table 13 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 1, Section 4.1.2.1.1].

 53  Other Possible Sites  
 
In addition to contamination from sources (associated with the two smelters) scored in this 
HRS evaluation, other potential sources of hazardous substances that may have contributed to contamination include mining and milling operations and pulp and paper production [see 
Figures 2 -1 and 5 of this HRS documentation record]. These contaminant sources are 
summarized in the following paragraphs. [emphasis added ] 
 
Celgar Pulp Mill - The Celgar Pulp Company (Celgar ) bleach kraft pulp mill is an additional 
source of hazardous substance contamination to the Columbia River, however, it is not included 
as a source in this HRS documentation record since this document has been limited to sources of 
inorganic contamination and the Celgar mill is instead a source of dioxin/furan contamination. 
The Celgar mill is in Castlegar, B.C., approximately 30 RMs upstream from the U.S.- Canada 
border [ Figure 2 -1 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 22, p. 20]. From 1961 until mid-1993, 
the mill primarily used chlorine in its bleaching process [Ref. 4, p. 31]. The pulp mill discharged 
effluent containing chlorinated organic compounds, including dioxins and furans, into the Columbia River [Ref. 4, p. 31]. 
 
Bonanza Mill  - The Bonanza Mill is located approximately 3 miles northwest of Colville, 
Washington, on the Colville River, a tributary of the Columbia River. The site is a former lead and zinc mill that operated from 1885 to 1952 [Ref. 7, p. 8, 9]. The facility contained a 100-ton flotation mill that processed ore using amalgamation, leaching, and/or flocculation, each of which 
utilized inorganic elements including mercury [Ref. 7, p. 8]. As a result of milling activities, 
approximately 17,500 cubic yards o f tailings and waste rock were spread across the facility [Ref. 
7, p. 11]. Analytical results of tailings/waste rock samples indicate the presence of significant concentrations of arsenic, barium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 7, pp. 30-31 (Table 6-1)]. Further, analytical results of sediment samples collected 
from the Colville River indicate the presence of lead at an elevated concentration and analytical 
results of sediment samples collected from on -site ditches draining to the Colville River indicate 
the presence of elevated concentrations of arsenic, barium, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 7, pp. 19, 89, 91- 92, 94, and 95]. After these sampling efforts, consultants 
for the EPA conducted a removal action at the facility which included placing 12 to 18 inches of 
either rock or clay barrier over exposed contaminated mine wastes [Ref. 47, pp. 3, 4]. The 
Bonanza Mill is not believed to be a source of the zone of contamination as scored in thi s HRS 
documentation record, as the Colville River discharges to the UCR downstream of the zone of contamination [Ref. 7, pp. 34, 36]. 
 
Young America Mine/Mill  – The Young America Mine is located approximately 3.6 miles 
northwest of Evans and is accessible from Highway 25 via Hutson Jones Way [Ref. 59, p. 5]…. 
The mine portion is located on the eastern side of Highway 25 and is located on land managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The mill and tailings impoundment portion of the 
site is located on four privately -owned parcels west of Highway 25 near the UCR. The mine 
operated between 1897 and 1953, mining zinc, lead, silver, and gold. The flotation mill was built 
(by Gregor Mines, Inc.) in the late 1940s and operated from 1948 to 1954. Tailings resulting from 
the mining operations were discharged downhill towards the west into an impoundment area 
located in the mill portion of  the site …. Laboratory analyses from soil samples collected from the 
mine and mill portions of the site indicated the presence of lead, arsenic, cadmium, and manganese above EPA Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) [Ref. 59, p. 9]. In 2012, EPA conducted a TCR A to consolidate and cap contaminated soil and tailings in the area around and 
below the mill buildings. Mill buildings were crushed in place, the existing cap was removed on the impoundment and the tailings and contaminated soil were capped with a liner and local 
material. The TCRA was completed on November 3, 2012 [Refs. 60, p. 2; 61, p. 2]. In the 2021 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 54  HHRA conducted by EPA, it was determined that there was no evidence that contamination 
moved down-river from the Young America Mine mill impoundment [Ref. 17, p. 62].  
 
Hahnlen Property – The Hahnlen Property is located approximately 3.6 miles northeast of Evans, 
WA on the east side of Highway 25. The UCR shoreline is located approximately 800 feet west of the property…. Approximately 31,568 square feet of lead- contaminated soil was covered with 
a liner; clean soil from a nearby source was placed on the liner Ref. 58, p. 14].  
 
Mines and Mills – Stevens County, Washington  
 In 2001, EPA conducted PA/SI investigations at 39 mines and mills in Stevens County, 
Washington. In addition to the Le Roi smelter, four sites were recommended for further action 
under CERCLA; an additional site (Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill) was later recommended for further 
action under CERCLA [Ref. 30, p. 1]. These sites are summarized below: 
 
Anderson Calhoun Mine/Mill  
 The Anderson Calhoun Mine/Mill is located 1 mile north of Leadpoint, Washington, on the west 
side of Deep Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River [5, pp. 136- 137]. The mine/mill is a former 
lead and zinc mine/mill that is reported to have been in operation from 1948 to 1952 [Ref. 5, p. 136]. The mine/mill contains a tailings pile measuring 555 feet by 500 feet by an unknown depth, a waste rock pile measuring 120 feet by 80 feet by 20 feet deep, an evaporation pond measuring 
105 feet by 50 feet, and a mine pit measuring 100 feet by 50 feet [Ref. 5, pp. 6-136, 139]. 
Analytical results documented significant concentrations of copper and mercury in the tailings 
pile. Lead and zinc were detected in water from the mine pit [Ref. 5, p. 140]. EPA removal action 
activities occurred at the site in 2010 [Ref. 17, p. 68]. The Anderson Calhoun Mine/Mill is not 
believed to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample 
(TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not 
exhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215- 216, 227, 451].  
 
Last Chance Mine/Mill  
 
The Last Chance Mine/Mill is located approximately 5 miles southeast of Northport, Washington, 
near Deep Creek, a tributary of the UCR. The facility is a former lead, silver, and zinc mine/mill 
that produced 5,937,708 pounds of lead; 18,567 pounds of silver and 110,110 pounds of zinc 
between 1904-1954 [Ref. 5, pp. 30, 114] …. Analytical results of waste rock samples indicate the 
presence of significant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, thallium, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 
175 (Table 6-13), 176, 235 (Figur e 6-24)]. A tailings pile is also present at the facility [Ref. 5, p. 
115]…. Analytical results of tailings samples indicate the presence of significant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, p. 175 (Table 6-13), 176, 235 (Figure 6-24)]. 
Further, an unnamed intermittent creek passes through one of the waste rock piles and the tailings pile as it flows toward Deep Creek [Ref. 5, p. 235 (Figure 6- 24)]. The Last Chance Mine/Mill is 
not believed to be a source of contamination to the UCR, a s analytical results from a tributary 
sample (TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not exhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215-216, 227, 451]. 
 
L-Bar/Northwest Magnesite 
 L-Bar/Northwest Magnesite facility is located approximately two miles south of Chewelah, 
Washington, on the south bank of the Colville River, a tributary of the UCR. The facility is a 
former magnesite plant that opened in 1916 and closed in 1968. In the mid-1970s, the facility was 
converted to recover magnesium from a magnesium processing byproduct commonly referred to Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 55  as flux bar. The magnesium recovery facility was closed in 1991 [Ref. 5, p. 78]. It has been 
demonstrated that flux bar and flux bar residue materials are sources of ammonia and chloride 
[Ref. 5, p.79]…. The L -Bar/Northwest Magnesite site is not believed to be a source of the zone of 
contamination as scored in this HRS documentation record, as the Colville River discharges to 
the UCR downstream of the zone of contamination [Ref. 5,pp. 258, 299]. 
 
Van Stone Mine/Mill  
 
The Van Stone Mine/Mill is located approximately 11 miles south of Northport, Washington, on Onion Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River. The facility is a former cadmium, lead, and zinc 
mine/mill that contains two tailings piles, a waste rock storage area, an open pit, a seepage pond, 
and stained soil areas [Ref. 5, pp. 94, 96]; Tailings from ore processing were slurried via a 
wooden flume to pile locations [Ref. 5, p. 95].… Analytical results of tailings samples indicate 
the presence of significant con centrations of lead, manganese, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 160-
165 (Table 6- 6), 166]. Analytical results of waste rock samples indicate the presence of 
significant concentrations of cadmium, lead, mercury, and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 158-160 (Table 6- 6), 
166]. Several unnamed creeks flow through the facility grounds to Onion Creek [Ref. 5, pp. 221 
(Figure 6 -13), 223 (Figure 6-14), and 262]. Surface water runoff from the tailings piles and the 
waste rock area drains to these unnamed creeks [Ref. 5, pp. 221 (Fi gure 6 -13), 262, 223 (Figure 
6-14)]. Analytical results of a sediment sample collected at the probable point of entry from one 
of the tailings piles to an adjacent unnamed creek indicate the presence of elevated concentrations of lead and zinc [Ref. 5, pp. 167 (Table 6-7), 168 and 223 (Figure 6-14)]. The Van Stone 
Mine/Mill underwent a removal action in 2017 [Ref. 17, p. 68].  The Van Stone Mine/Mill is not 
believed to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample 
(TS099) collected from Onion Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not 
exhibit significant concentrati ons of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 213- 214, 227, 450].  
 
Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill  
 
The Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill is located approximately 17 miles south of Northport, Washington, on 
the west side of Deep Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River. The mine/mill is a former gold, lead, silver, and zinc mine/mill that operated sporadically from 1909 to 1952 [Ref. 5, pp. 30, 
124]. The mine/mill contains a tailings pile measuring 1,000 feet by 2,100 feet by approximately 20 feet deep and a waste rock pile measuring 100 feet by 50 feet by 5 feet deep [Ref. 5, pp. 124-
125]. Analytical results document significant concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, 
and zinc in both the tailings pile and the waste rock pile [Ref. 5, p. 126]. The Sierra Zinc Mine/Mill underwent removal actions in 2001 and 2002 [Ref. 17, pp. 67-68]. The Sierra Zinc 
Mine/Mill underwent a removal action in 2017 [Ref. 17, p. 68]. The Van Stone Mine/Mill is not 
believed to be a source of contamination to the UCR, as analytical results from a tributary sample 
(TS105) collected from Deep Creek at its confluence with the UCR during the 2001 ESI did not 
exhibit significant concentrations of metals [Ref. 4, pp. 215- 216, 227, 451].  
 
Mines and Mills – Pend Oreille County, Washington  
 
In 2001-2002, EPA conducted PA/SI investigations at 21 mines and mills in Pend Oreille County, 
Washington. During this investigation, a total of five sites were recommended for further action 
under CERCLA. Three of the sites have since had their status changed to no further remedial 
action planned (NFRAP) [Ref. 31, p. 1]. The remaining sites are summarized below:   
Josephine Mine  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 56  The Josephine Mine is a former zinc, lead, silver, and cadmium mine located in the Metaline 
mining district. The mine area consisted of a shaft, a waste rock pile, a small building, and 
collapsing wood structure. The mine is located directly across the Pend Oreille River from the 
Pend Oreille Mine/Mill. Analytical results of a sediment sample at the probable point of entry of a waste rock pile to the Pend Oreille River documented significant concentrations of cadmium, 
lead, mercury, silver, and zinc [Ref. 6, pp. 50-53, 133]. The Josephine Mine underwent a removal 
action; the site was deemed to have localized contaminant concentrations that met EPA requirements for a removal action; however, the Josephine Mine was not identified as a source of 
contamination to the UCR site [Ref. 17, p. 62].   
Grandview Mine/Mill  
 
The Grandview Mine/Mill is located in the lower Pend Oreille River Valley, approximately 0.75 
mile from the east bank of the Pend Oreille River, approximately 2 miles northeast of Metaline 
Falls, Washington. Source areas identified on site included a taili ngs pile, waste rock piles, and an 
abandoned container and drum area. Analytical results from sampling events conducted in 2000 
and 2001 indicated that the Grandview Mine/Mill is a source of hazardous substance 
contamination to groundwater drinking water wells, an unnamed spring, a former wastewater 
ditch, and the Pend Oreille River. Contaminants detected at elevated concentrations in a sediment 
sample collected from the Pend Oreille River included cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc [Ref. 6, 
pp. 52-53, 134-135]. The Grandview Mine/Mill underwent a removal action; the site was deemed 
to have localized contaminant concentrations that met EPA requirements for a removal action; 
however, the Grandview Mine/Mill was not identified as a source of contamination to the UCR 
site [Ref. 17, p. 62]. 
 
Thus, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly established that the observed release by chemical analysis to surface water was attributable, at least in part, to the Site, and included discussion of other non- site-
related possible contributors to the contamination. ( The significant increase in hazardous substances compared to 
the background level was not challenged by the commenter.) The 11 other possible sites that were identified 
during the HRS evaluation were used to help determine that the observed release was attributable, at least in part, 
to the site as discussed in the Attribution section on pages 77-81 of the HRS documentation record at proposal 
quoted above.  
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 3.21.3  Waste Characteristics  
Comment : TAI stated that the w aste c haracteristics f actor category value, in conjunction with the hazardous waste 
quantity and t oxicity/persistence /bioaccumulation  factor values, was used to determine a maximum human food 
chain threat score that likely overestimates the risk posed by the Site. TAI commented that this approach is 
inconsistent with Site conditions and is not supported by RI/FS data.  
 TAI commented that the metals in the historically released slag have limited bioavailability. TAI asserted that the 
slow release rates of metals from slag are evident at the Site, as indicated by the low concentrations of metals in 
surface water from the Upper Columbia River.  
 
Response : The waste characteristics factor category value was correctly calculated in accordance with the HRS in 
the HRS documentation record at proposal. The related factor values (i.e., the hazardous waste quantity factor value, toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation) used in the waste characteristics factor category value calculation were also properly assigned in the HRS documentation record at proposal.  
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 57  In discussing the procedure to evaluate the human food chain threat waste characteristics, HRS Section 4.1.3.2, 
Human food chain threat -waste characteristics, states to “[e]valuate the waste characteristics factor category for 
each watershed based on two factors: toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation and hazardous waste quantity.”  
 HRS Section 4.1.3.2.2, Hazardous waste quantity , instructs to “[a] ssign  the same factor value for hazardous waste  
quantity for the watershed as would be assigned in section 4.1.2.2.2 for the drinking water threat. ” HRS Section, 
4.1.2.2.2, Hazardous waste quantity , in turn states to “[a] ssign a  hazardous waste quantity factor value for  the 
watershed as specified in section 2.4.2.” HRS Section 2.4.2, Hazardous waste quantity , in relevant part at 2.4.2.2, 
states:   
 
Sum the source hazardous  waste quantity values assigned to all sources (including the unallocated 
source) or areas  of observed contamination, areas of observed exposure, or areas of subsurface 
contamination  for the pathway being evaluated and round this sum to the nearest integer, except:  
If the sum is greater than 0, but less  than 1, round it to 1. Based on this value, select  a hazardous 
waste quantity factor value for the pathway from Table 2–6.

HRS Section 4.1.3.2.1.4, Calculation of toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value , states how the 
bioaccumulation potential factor value is used to determine the toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value 
for a hazardous substance:  
 
Assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence factor value from Table 4 –12, based on 
the values assigned to the hazardous substance for the toxicity and persistence factors. Then assign each hazardous substance a toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value from Table 4–16, based on the values assigned for the toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation potential 
factors. Use the hazardous substance with the highest toxicity/persistence/bioaccumulation factor value for the watershed to assign the value to this factor. Enter this value in Table 4–1.  
 HRS Section 4.1.3.2.3, Calculation of human food chain threat -waste characteristics factor category value, 
describes how a bioaccumulation potential factor value is used to calculate a human food chain threat -waste 
characteristics factor category for the watershed:  
 
For the hazardous substance selected for the watershed in section 4.1.3.2.1.4, use its toxicity/persistence factor value and bioaccumulation potential factor value as follows to assign a 
value to the waste characteristics factor category. First, multiply t he toxicity/persistence factor 
value and the hazardous waste quantity factor value for the watershed, subject to a maximum product of 1x10
8. Then multiply this product by the bioaccumulation potential factor value for 
this hazardous substance, subject to a  maximum product of 1x1012. Based on this second product, Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 58  assign a value from Table 2 –7 (section 2.4.3.1) to the human food chain threat- waste 
characteristics factor category for the watershed. Enter this value in Table 4 –1.

the hazardous waste quantity factor value for that pathway [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.2.2]. Therefore, a hazardous waste quantity factor value of 1,000,000 is assigned for the surface water migration 
pathway.

4.1.3.2.3 Waste Characteristics Factor Category Value  
 
Mercury and cadmium are documented in observed releases and associated with Sources 1, 2, and 
3, which have a surface water pathway containment factor value greater than 0 for the watershed 
and correspond to a toxicity/persistence factor value of 10,000 and bioaccumulation potential 
factor value of 50,000, as shown above [Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.1.4; 2, pp. 12, 32].  
 
(Toxicity/Persistence Factor Value) x (Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value) =  
10,000 x 1,000,000 = 1 x 1010  
(Subject to a maximum of 1 x 108)  
[Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.3]  
 
(Toxicity/Persistence Factor Value x Hazardous Waste Quantity Factor Value) x  
(Bioaccumulation Potential Factor Value) = (1 x 108) x (50,000) = 5 x 1012  
(Subject to a maximum of 1 x 1012)  
[Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.2.3]  
 
The resulting waste characteristics product of 1 x 1012 corresponds to a Waste Characteristics 
Factor Category Value of 1,000 in Table 2-7 of the HRS [Ref. 1, Section 2.4.3.1]. 
 
Thus, the HRS documentation record at proposal evaluated each of the related factor values (i.e., toxicity, 
persistence, bioaccumulation, and hazardous waste quantity factor values) to determine the waste characteristics factor category value consistent with the HRS. The hazardous waste quantity factor value was based on the 
combined sum of the Sources 1 -3 hazardous waste quantity values and HRS Table 2- 6 as presented above in the 
quoted text from page 82 of the HRS documentation record at proposal. The tox icity, persistence, and 
bioaccumulation factor values were determined based on an eligible hazardous substance as presented on page 82 
of the HRS documentation record at proposal, quoted above. As noted on page 83 of the HRS documentation 
record at proposal, mercury and cadmium were determined to be the highest scoring hazardous substances with 
identical values for toxicity/persistence and bioaccumulation. These values associated with mercury and  cadmium 
were used to calculate the waste characteristics fact or category value (i.e., 5 x 10
12, subject to a maximum of 1 x 
1012) in accordance with the HRS as presented in calculations on page 83 of the HRS documentation record at 
proposal.   
Regarding the bioavailability of metals in sediments,  the HRS does not consider the bioavailability of hazardous 
substances in an HRS evaluation. 
 
Regarding the rate of release of metals from slag to water, for source material that has already migrated into a 
pathway medium— i.e., slag in surface water sediments for the Site— the HRS scoring factors for the surface 
water migration pathway do not consider this  rate. That is, HRS scoring does not consider the rate that metals 
from waste material in sediment might dissolve into the water. Therefore, t his type of leaching process is  not 
considered in the HRS site score.  
 As these comments relate to the risk posed by the Site, please see section 3.15, Risk to Human Health or the 
Environment, of this support document for the discussion of site- related risk.

uman Food Chain Threat - Targets  
Comment: TAI provided comments discussing the level of contamination in fish. TAI commented that a 
misleading statement27 is present in the HRS documentation record at proposal that misidentifies the author28 of a 
fish consumption Technical Summary. TAI asserted that while an advisory acknowledges contamination, the EPA 
determined that fish from the Columbia River are generally safe for consumption. TAI commented that low levels 
of lead are present in fish species except for largescale suckers, which are not widely consumed. TAI also stated 
that hazardous substances unrelated to the Site may be the driver behind fish advisories in place for sensitive groups.  
Response : Insomuch as these comments question the scoring of the human food chain threat of the HRS  and the 
presence of a human food chain fishery, fishing for human consumption within the zone of actual contamination was sufficiently documented to score the human food chain threat.  
HRS
 Section 4.1.3.3, Human food chain threat- targets, provides instructions for evaluating targets in the 
human food chain threat and states in relevant part:  
Eval
uate two target factors for each watershed: food chain individual and population. For both 
factors, determine whether the target fisheries are subject to actual or potential human food chain 
contamination. 
Consider a fishery (or portion of a fishery) within the target distance limit of the watershed to be 
subject to actual human food chain contamination if any of the following apply: 
•A hazardous substance having a bioaccumulation potential factor value of 500 or greater
is present either in an observed release by direct observation to the watershed or in a
surface water or sediment sample from the watershed at a level that meets the cr iteria for
an observed release to the watershed from the site, and at least a portion of the fishery is
within the boundaries of the observed release (that is, it is located either at the point of
direct observation or at or between the probable point of e ntry and the most distant
sampling point establishing the observed release)….  
When a fishery (or portion of a fishery) is subject to actual food chain contamination, determine 
the part of the fishery subject to Level I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations. If the actual food chain contamination is based on direct observation, evaluate it 
using Level II concentrations. However, if the actual food chain contamination is based on 
samples from the watershed, use these samples and, if available, additional tissue samples from 
aquatic human food chain organisms as specified below, to determine the part subject to Level I concentrations and the part subject to Level II concentrations: 
•Determine the level of actual contamination from samples (including tissue samples from
essentially sessile, benthic organisms) that meet the criteria for actual food chain
contamination by comparing the exposure concentrations (see section 4.1.2.3) from these
samples (or comparable samples) to the health -based benchmarks from table 4 -17, as
described in section 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. Use only the exposure concentrations for those
27 TAI referred to page 84 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, pointing to the following statement, “[a] WSDH fish 
consumption advisory Technical Summary (d ated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a primary source  of metals and 
other chemical contaminants in the UCR [Ref. 52, p. 1].” 
28 TAI asserted  that the referen ce document identifies the EPA as the author of the statement, which stat es that “‘[t]he U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified the Trail Smelter operated by Teck Cominco (now called Teck) as the 
primary source of metals.’” Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 61  hazardous substances in the sample (or comparable samples) that meet the criteria for 
actual contamination of the fishery.  
 
HRS Section 4.1.3.3.2.2, Level II concentrations, provides instructions for the evaluation a fishery subject to 
Level II concentrations. It states:  
 
Determine those fisheries (or portions of fisheries) within the watershed that are subject to Level 
II concentrations. Do not include any fisheries (or portions of fisheries) already counted under the 
Level I concentrations factor.  
 
Assign each fishery (or portion of a fishery) a value for human food chain population from table 
4–18, based on the estimated human food production for the fishery. Estimate the human food 
chain production for the fishery as specified in section 4.1.3.3.2.1.  
 In describing the targets eligible for scoring in the human food chain threat , page 84 of the HRS documentation 
record at proposal indicate d: 
 
4.1.3.3 Human Food Chain Threat - Targets  
 The zone of actual contamination is the area of the UCR between the most upstream PPE (PPE1) 
and farthest downstream observed release sample (EV001 -SED -1-092619). As stated previously, 
contamination and targets are not scored for the portion of the UCR loc ated in Canada (i.e., 
between PPE1 and the U.S. -Canada border). Scored contamination and targets are evaluated for 
the U.S. portion of the zone of contamination, which encompasses a length of approximately 35 
miles [ Figure 3 of this HRS documentation recor d].  
 
There is an observed release of metals contaminants to the UCR [see Section 4.1.2.1.1 of this 
HRS documentation record], which is used for consumption fishing. Species caught for 
consumption in the UCR from the U.S.–Canada border to Marcus Washington (and within the 
scored zone of actual contamination) include walleye, sturgeon, rainbow trout, kokanee, and 
northern pike [Refs. 24, p. 1; 56, p. 1]. The original north boundary of the Colville Indian 
Reservation was the Canadian border; this former “North Half ” of the Colville Indian Reservation 
continues to be an important homeland to the CCT. The CCT exercises certain management and 
regulatory authority in this area from the northern boundary of the current reservation north to the 
Canadian border, bounded by the Okanogan and Columbia rivers. CCT -owned land and 
individual tribal members reside on the North Half and use the lands, waters, and natural 
resources for cultural and subsistence uses as they do on the reservation [Refs. 17, p. 61; 20, pp. 
1-2; 21, pp. 1-2, 4].  
 The Washington State Department of Health (WSDH) has a fish advisory in place for the 
consumption of various fish due to mercury and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concerns. The 
advisory covers the portion of the UCR from the U.S.- Canada border to the Grand Coulee Dam. 
Guidelines are in place for the consumption of species within the UCR including kokanee, lake 
whitefish, rainbow trout, white sturgeon, northern pike, burbot, longnose sucker, mountain 
whitefish, smallmouth bass, walleye, largescale sucker, a nd largemouth bass. A do- not-eat 
advisory is in place for northern pikeminnow [Ref. 23, p. 1]. A WSDH fish consumption advisory 
Technical Summary (dated July 2012) identifies the Teck smelter as a primary source of metals 
and other chemical contaminants in the UCR [Ref. 52, p. 1].

with targets in the human food chain threat  and stated: 
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 62  4.1.3.3.2.2 Level II Concentrations  
 
The zone of actual contamination is the area of the UCR between the most upstream PPE (PPE1) 
and farthest downstream observed release sample (EV001- SED -1-092619)…. The scored zone of 
actual contamination in the UCR is used for consumption fishing [Refs. 24, p. 1; 56, p. 1]. 
Species caught for consumption in the scored zone of actual contamination include walleye, 
sturgeon, rainbow trout, kokanee and northern pike [Refs. 24, p. 1, 56. p. 1].  
 
The food chain production for the fishery is not documented, so based on the aforementioned information, the fishery is assigned to the category “Greater than 0 to 100 pounds per year,” 
which corresponds to the assigned human food chain population value of 0.03 in Table 4-18 of 
the HRS [Ref. 1, Section 4.1.3.3.2.2]. The available documentation demonstrates that fishing for human consumption occurs within the scored zone of actual contamination delineated by metals 
detected in sediment samples at concentrati ons meeting observed release criteria (i.e., 
significantly above background and attributable to the site); therefore, the target fishery is evaluated for Level II actual contamination [ Figure 3 of this HRS documentation record; Ref. 1, 
Section 4.1.3.3; 24, p. 1]. 
 
Page 86 of the HRS documentation record at proposal cited References 24 and 56. Reference 24 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, a phone conversation record with a manager for a fishing tour company, states:  
 
Mr. Lawson stated that although the guided tours target rainbow trout, which are caught and released, he knows that the portion of the Upper Columbia River from the U.S- Canada border to 
Marcus, Washington is fished for consumption. Species caught for consu mption include walleye, 
sturgeon, rainbow trout and northern pike. 
 
Reference 56 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, a phone conversation record with a retired professor 
of biology from Eastern Washington University, states:  
 
Professor Scholz also informed me that this portion of the UCR (between the U.S.-Canada border and Marcus, WA) is fished for consumption. Species caught for consumption include walleye, red 
band trout (a type of rainbow trout), kokanee, white sturgeon, and northern pike. He also 
informed me that Colville Tribes still fish the UCR for subsistence, including the North Half, 
which fished the upper portion of the UCR between the U.S.-Canada border border [ sic] and 
Marcus, WA.
 
 
Thus, the HRS documentation record at proposal provided sufficient documentation to support that a human food chain fishery is present at the Site to score a fishery as a target for HRS scoring purposes. Consistent with the 
HRS instructions regarding identifying a fishery subject to actual human food chain contamination, the HRS 
documentation record at proposal documented that fish are caught and consumed from within the zone of actual 
contamination t o establish that a Level II fishery.  
 
Regarding Reference 52 of the HRS documentation record at proposal, while this reference was used to help 
provide context regarding the presence of a fishery as indicated on page 84 of the HRS documentation record at 
proposal, this reference was not relied on to document a fishery within the zone of contamination at the Site. As 
noted above, two records of conversation (one each in References 24 and 56 ) were used to document the presence 
of a human food chain fishery within the zone of contamination. See section 3.18, Non -Scoring HRS 
Documentation Record Comments, of this support document for clarifications related to Reference 52 and associated HRS documentation record text.  
 
This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 63  3.22 Soil Exposure Component  
Comment: TAI and Stevens County commented that it is unclear whether scoring the upland soil contamination 
would achieve an NPL eligible score. TAI asserted that it is also unlikely that the soil contamination would 
achieve a sufficient HRS site score as properties above the Action Level have been remediated and the area is 
rural.  
 
TAI and Stevens County provided comments questioning whether the areas with contaminated soil were 
appropriately evaluated and considered residential. TAI asserted that the extent of the residential soil 
contamination described in general EPA communications is overstated because non -residential land use areas are 
included. Stevens County commented that areas categorized as residential for scoring also include forest, industrial, and commercial areas. It stated that EPA representatives have alluded to the ar ea as residential even 
though many of the sampling areas are zoned as forest. It commented that it could identify where residential 
development may occur. It asserted that the other non- residential areas that have been sampled are not eligible as 
residenti al areas for scoring or eligible under the soil lead guidance. Stevens County concluded that the resulting 
scoring of these non- residential areas is incorrect.  
 TAI asserted that the soil contamination, as opposed to the entire Upper Columbia River site, appears to be the 
possible justification for placing the Site on the NPL. TAI acknowledged that the soil contamination may involve properties below future cleanup levels, but also stated that the presence “of some areas with lead concentrations 
above EPA’s new screening levels is not an appropriate basis for Listing a particular site.”  
 
Response: Insomuch as the commenter’s assertions are related to the evaluation of the soil exposure component, 
the soil exposure component of the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway was properly scored in 
accordance with the HRS in delineating an AOC. Further, when an HRS score is calculated, each individual 
pathway does not need to achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score, as the HRS site score is based on a 
combination of the individual pathway scores. In this case, the HRS evaluation of the Site included the surface 
water migration pathway in addition to the soil exposure component in scoring, and the Site achieved an NPL 
eligible HRS site score of 51.15 , which is above the minimum threshold for NPL placement. 
 
The commenters’ specific points regarding scoring the soil exposure component, property types, and soil sample 
concentrations do not affect or invalidate the HRS site score:  
 
• On the subject of what properties are eligible for consideration in the delineating the AOC, the AOC is 
delineated based on samples meeting observed contamination criteria. T he HRS does not  restrict observed 
contamination to a specific property type.  
• On the subject of the pathway- specific score achieved by the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway, 
the HRS does not require that an individual pathway independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score.  
• On the subject of the presence of properties with soil contamination below an action level, residents may be eligible for scoring in the soil exposure component even if located at properties with soil sample 
concentrations below an action level.  
 
In presenting the instructions for determining eligible soil contamination, HRS Section 5.1.0, General considerations , states:  
 
• Establish areas of observed contamination based on sampling locations at which there is  
observed contamination as follows.  
- For all sources except contaminated soil, if observed contamination from the site is 
present at any sampling location within the source, consider that entire source to be an 
area of  observed contamination.  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document  December 2024  
 
 64  - For contaminated soil, consider both the sampling location(s) with observed 
contamination from the  site and the area lying between such locations to be an area of 
observed contamination, unless  available information indicates otherwise.  
• If an area of observed contamination (or portion of such an area) is covered by a permanent, 
or otherwise maintained, essentially impenetrable material (for example, asphalt) that is not 
more  than 2 feet thick, exclude that area (or portion of the area) in evaluating the soil 
exposure  component.  
• For an area of observed contamination, consider only those hazardous substances that meet the criteria  for observed contamination for that area to be associated with that area in 
evaluating the soil exposure  component (see section 2.2.2).  
 Further instructions for assessing the resident population threat are presented in HRS Section 5.1.1, Resident 
population threat . This section states:  
 
Evaluate the resident population threat only if there is an area of observed contamination in one or more of the following locations:  
• Within the property boundary of a residence, school, or day care center and within 
200 feet of the respective residence, school, or day care center, or  
• Within a workplace property boundary and within 200 feet of a workplace area, or  
• Within the boundaries of a resource specified in section 5.1.1.3.4, or  
• Within the boundaries of a terrestrial sensitive environment specified in section 5. 1.1.3.5 
[emphasis added]  
 
For assessing the targets factor category, HRS Section 5.1.1.3, Targets , instructs a scorer, in part, to:  
 
Evaluate the targets factor category for the resident population threat based on five factors: 
resident individual, resident population, workers, resources, and terrestrial sensitive 
environments.  
In evaluating the targets factor category for the resident population threat, count only the following as targets:  
• Resident individual – a person living or attending school or day care on a property with 
an area of observed contamination and whose residence, school, or day care center, 
respectively,  is on or within 200 feet of the areas of observed contamination.  
• Worker – a person working on a property with an area of observed contamination and 
whose  workplace area is on or within 200 feet of the area of observed contamination.…  
 
In describing the scoring of the AOC, page 92 of the HRS documentation record at proposal state d:  
 
AOC A is defined by a polygon bounded by soil contamination meeting HRS observed contamination criteria (i.e., locations showing lead and arsenic at concentrations significantly 
above published background levels and collected from the top 2 feet of soil) … However, since 
EPA has conducted removal activities at many properties in the Northport area dating back to 2003 [see Site Summary section of this HRS documentation record], not all properties were 
included within the AOC polygon; for the purpose of deter mining the hazardous waste quantity 
area and resident population for the AOC, a conservative approach was taken and only 
contaminated properties from the 2021 RSE sampling event, that did not have soil removals, were 
included in the calculation …. Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024 
 
 65   
EPA has identified 16 properties with dwellings that are affected by the AOC. Four of these 
properties are subject to Level I contamination of arsenic (based on sample results greater than the cancer risk screening concentration benchmark of 0.772 mg/kg); 12 properties are subject to Level II contamination of lead (no benchmark established) .

*  Reference 38 has conflicting information with regard to the depth of soil sample JEAM5; Pages 306- 307 
indicates a depth of 0 -1 inch bgs; page 354 indicates a sample depth of 6 -7 inches bgs.  Reference 38, page 
14 indicates that sampling depths for yards  were typically 0 -1 inch; therefore, since the sample was 
collected from a front yard, it is likely that the sample depth for Sample JEAM5 was 0- 1 inch bgs.   
Note:     Background concentration for arsenic is evaluated as 11 mg/kg (Observed Contamination = 33 
mg/kg or above) [Ref. 39, p. 51].  
 Note – Property 53 (which in included in AOC A [Sample JDHG2]) was noted to be a vacant lot during 
sampling; it was recently purchased and there are plans to build a house on the lot.  Therefore, while the sample concentration exceeds the relevant benchmark, s ince no dwellings are known to currently exist on 
the property, resident populations are not scored below for Property 53 [Ref. 38, pp. 80, 96, 348 -349].  Upper Columbia River NPL Listing Support Document December 2024

Although Property 25 qualified for inclusion in AOC A, resident populations are not scored for Property 25 
since portions of the composite sampling area (for composite soil sample JEAJ2) are located greater than 200 feet from the property dwelling [Ref. 38, pp. 58, 314- 315].  
 
In explaining the scoring of the r esident individual factor value, page 107 of the HRS documentation record at 
proposal state d: 
 
Since there is at least one documented resident individual living on a property within an AOC and 
within 200 feet of contamination subject to Level I actual contamination, a Resident Individual 
Factor value of 50 is applicable  
 
In discussing the scoring of the Level I and Level II concentrations factors, page 108 of the HRS documentation 
record at proposal stated :  
 
5.1.1.3.2.1 Level I Concentrations  
 
Observed contamination has been observed at residences in AOC A [see Section 5.1.0 of this 
HRS documentation record]. The population of the residences was obtained by multiplying the 
number of residences by the U.S. Census (2017-2021) average persons per dwelling in Stevens 
County, Washington [Ref. 45, p. 2]. Based on residential sampling conducted by EPA in 2021, a 
total of 4 homes are subject to Level I concentrations …. 
 
5.1.1.3.2.2 Level II Concentrations  
 
Observed contamination has been documented at residences in AOC A [see Section 5.1.0 of this 
HRS documentation record]. The population of the residences was obtained by multiplying the number of residences by the U.S. Census (2017-2021) average persons per dwelling in Stevens 
County, Washington [Ref. 45, p. 2]. Based on residential sampling conducted by EPA in 2021, a 
total of 12 homes are subject to Level II concentrations…

The HRS documentation record at proposal properly identified eligible samples to establish an AOC for HRS 
scoring and correctly identified the population associated with eligible residences.  The AOC was determined 
based on soil samples meeting observed contamination criteria for lead and/or arsenic as specified in HRS Section 
5.1.0. The commenter has not challenged the evaluation of whether particular samples used to delineate the AOC 
met observed contamination criteria. In accordance with the instructions in HRS Sections 5.1.0, 5.1.1, and 5.1.1.3, 
and as presented on pages 92, 100, 102, 103, 107, and 108 of the HRS documentation record at proposa l, quoted 
above, eligible residents were determined based on either inferred contamination on residences being located 
within the AOC or samples meeting observed contamination criteria that were collected on the property and 
within 200 feet of a residence. Thus, the HRS documentation record at proposal identified eligible residents 
during the evaluation of the population associated with eligible residences consistent with the HRS requirements.  
 
The HRS does not require that an individual pathway independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score. The 
HRS site score, which takes into account the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway score, is greater than the NPL placement threshold of 28.50 making this Site eligible for placement on the NPL. The soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathw ay score of 21.66 does not independently achieve an NPL eligible HRS site score; 
however, per HRS Section 2.1.1, Calculation of HRS site score , an HRS site score is calculated using the pathway 
scores from all four pathways for the Site. At this Site, the surface water migration pathway was also evaluated 
and received a pathway score of 100.00. Following the HRS methodology and accounting for the scores from the 
two pathways scored, the resulting HRS site score is 51.15 making the Site eligible for NPL placement. The rationale for placing the Site on the NPL is in part due to the Site achieving an NPL eligible HRS site score based 
on the evaluation of both the surface water migration and the soil exposure and subsurface intrusion pathway s 
consistent with the HRS requirements for scoring a site.   
Regarding the consideration of the  action level in determining eligible samples and residents, as explained above 
in section 3.16, Regulatory Limits and Screening Levels, of this support document, contamination below an action 
level or other screening level may still be eligible for consideration in documenting observed contamination. The 
HRS uses the criteria for observed contamination as specified in HRS Section 5.1.0, quoted above, to evaluate the soil exposure component. As explained above, the HRS documentation record at proposal properly determined 
which soil samples met observed contamination criteria, which is not challenged by the commenter. Residences and associated residents were also correctly calculated as explained above.  
 This comment results in no change to the HRS score and no change in the decision to place the Site on the NPL. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The original HRS score for this site was 5 1.15. Based on the above responses to public comments, the score 
remains unchanged. The final scores for the Upper Columbia River site are:  
 
Ground Water:      Not S cored  
Surface Water:       100.00 
Soil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion:   21.66 
Air Pathway:       Not S cored  
HRS Score:       51.15

Re: concurrence on Superfund listing of the Upper Columbia River Site 
Dear Administrator Sixkiller: 
I received your letter dated November 30, 2023 in regard to the proposed addition of the Upper Columbia 
River ("UCR") Site to the Superfund National Priorities List ("NPL"). The Colville Tribes supports placement 
of the UCR Site on the NPL. 
The UCR Site includes areas within the traditional homeland, and current Reservation, of the Colville 
Tribes. Historical disposal and discharges of wastes and emissions from smelter operations have 
contaminated the UCR Site and pose a risk to human health as well as to the sovereignty and economic 
security of the Colville Tribes. 
As you correctly note in your letter, the Colville Tribes has worked for at least two decades to address the 
legacy of contamination at the UCR Site, including litigation with our partners in the federal government, the 
State of Washington, and the Spokane Tribe of Indians. An NPL listing will allow access to resources that 
are much needed for remediation of the UCR Site. 
The Colville Tribes appreciates and accepts your offer to coordinate with our staff as the NPL listing 
process proceeds. Thank you for this effort to bring maximum resources to this remediation as quickly as 
possible.
